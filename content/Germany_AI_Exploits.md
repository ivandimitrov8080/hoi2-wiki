##  AI Exploits 

###  French AI Exploitation 

In most games France has more than 70 divisions at the start of the war.
There is an easy way to remove around half of them. After the fall of
Poland, put most of your armies in Nuremberg or Frankfurt. Put 6
divisions in Stuttgart, 6 in Saarbrücken and only 3 in Freiburg. Most of
the time, the AI will attack Freiburg and makes a breakthrough to
southern German provinces. In the event that they don't attack, removing
the garrisons in Freiburg alltogether will stimulate the AI into an
attack. The French AI will rush in and try to capture as many Southern
German provinces as possible. When you are ready to cut them off, attack
and capture Freiburg. By doing this, all the French troops that are
behind your lines quickly become out of supply. This will allow you to
destroy a large portion of the French army.

###  USSR AI Exploitation 

The French supply cut-off trick also applies in many other similar
situations, such as during the invasion of the USSR. The USSR front is
huge and the numbers of divisions in play are very large. It is possible
that you could lose control of the situation if you are not careful.
Note that the AI in 1.3 and above is much better about garrisoning
provinces that it has captured in order to maintain supply to its
troops. Use this strategy with caution, as it could easily backfire.

###  The Amphibious Option: Spain 

An easy conquest of Spain can be accomplished by building transports and
convoys from the start of 1936. With only 3 to 6 transports by April 1,
you can launch a successful invasion of Spain. As Republican Spain has
no guarantees or alliances to protect itself from foreign aggression,
you will not have to worry about the Allies at this time. By shuttling
9 - 18 divisions to Spain using your brand new transports, you should be
able to annex Republican Spain by the end of the summer or even as early
as July. This gives you an ideal launching point for invading Gibraltar
and France when war with the Allies occurs. This will also give you the
needed transports to launch an invasion of the UK as well. If you plan
for the UK, make sure to research marines to create the bridgehead.
Invading France from Spain exploits the AI weakness as it does not
reinforce that border in sufficient numbers. You could potentially be in
Paris within two weeks of the outbreak of war and have most of western
and southern France at the same time. If you release Nationalist Spain,
you lose the belligerence. You also get a puppet-base for attacking
France later.

###  Aggressive Amphibious Assault on USSR 

1.  Attack Poland as early as possible, destroy the Polish army and
    capture all territories, BUT NOT the border territories to Soviet
    Union! These territories are your buffer to the Soviet Union. DO NOT
    annex Poland, or you will lose your buffer.
2.  Declare war on the Soviets and invade Leningrad directly or through
    the province southwest of it. Then bring about 10 Inf + 1 HQ to
    Leningrad and wait. The Soviets will bring 50-60 (or more) units to
    the surrounding provinces. But with 10 Inf and 5 Fortification in
    Leningrad they don´t attack you (or they don´t succeed in
    attacking).
3.  The West Front of the Soviet Union is now open; very few troops
    there. Go through the last Polish territories to attack the SU. Use
    cavalry or tanks to go quickly to the east and capture as much
    territory as possible. Sometimes, you can walk to Stalingrad without
    fighting.
4.  You must close the trap for the big Soviet armies with your small
    forces. The goal is to cut supply to the Soviet armies.
    1.  Invade Murmansk with a small force. Use it as a new base and
        then invade Archangelsk.
    2.  At the same time, go with tanks, cavalry and HQs directly to
        Moscow. Your slow infantry follows.
5.  Until now there shouldn´t be much resistance from the Soviet armies;
    They wait near Leningrad. Now the tricky part begins.
    1.  You must go from Archangelsk to Moscow and from Moscow to
        Stalingrad to close the east side of the trap. No supply for the
        Soviet armies from land.
    2.  After a short time the AI will supply via the coastal
        territories. So the next goal is to conquer the coastal
        territoris to finally shut the Soviet armies off from any
        supply.
        -   Perhaps you can alternatively destroy all Soviet convoys - I
            didn´t try.
6.  Without supply you can go battle to battle to tear the bear down.

Finally: It is not easy to hold the Soviet armies in the trap and to get
the trap closed. But the price is it worth. About 75 Soviet armies could
be destroyed in a few months.

###  Poland as an Ally 

This is to be used if you have a large amount of IC. If you build
factories (you always should anyway), say around 15 x 2 starting in
May-June 1936 (after expending first months overstocking supplies) you
will have an IC of around 300 by Sept 1939. Increasing the Central
Planning slider will help as well.

1.  If you influence Poland enough, up to +200, they will join you after
    2 or 3 attempts. The advantage of this is that you can take France,
    Denmark, Holland and Belgium before the fall of 1939 (if you play
    historically).
2.  Once Poland is your ally, you can asume military control over them
    along with your other allies (Hungary, Slovakia, etc). These forces
    can be used to protect your rear from attack, for example protecting
    France while you invade the USSR in 1941.
3.  A weak point of this strategy is that Russia will be annexed by
    Poland (if you are attacking it from Polish territories) so you
    won't gain anything IC-wise by invading Russia. However, with Russia
    down, that is not be a problem.

##    Event Avoidance/Exploitation 

###  Czechoslovakia 

If you annexed Hungary via the above strategy, then wait for the Treaty
of Munich and The End of Czechoslovakia fire. In The End of
Czechoslovakia, choose the second option (partition Czechoslovakia
between Germany and Hungary). Since Hungary does not exist anymore, you
gain the whole Czechoslovakia! \[1.2!\]

In 1.3, this has changed. A Germany that occupies Hungary is forced to
found Slovakia through this event. Therefore, a strong Hungary might be
a better way to go since it has three tech teams when it gets Slovakia.

###  Annexing Denmark with Greenland and Iceland 

It is very easy to annex Denmark due to an event that simulates Denmark
surrendering once Germany occupies Kolding (The province located
directly north of Kiel). However this event gives away Iceland and
Greenland to the UK and United States, respecively. This is not a good
idea if you want to stack armies in Canada in preparation to attack USA
before it declares war on you.

There are two options to annex all of Denmark, Iceland and Greenland:

-   Bypass Kolding by using either amphibious or airborn attacks against
    Arhus, Odense, and Copenhagen.
-   Attack and annex Denmark prior to annexing Poland (in this case, you
    can capture Kolding without having the event fire. Doing this makes
    an Allied DoW against you probable, due to the increase in your
    belligerence)

Note that Greenland & Iceland is not the only, or arguably even the
best, route to North America. Bermuda may be the better choice. Evaluate
your options carefully before going out of your way to grab Greenland &
Iceland.

##  Central Asia 

Inviting Central Asian Nations to the Axis is a very risky proposition
during your war with the USSR. Gaining countries such as Persia and
Afghanistan will probably hurt Germany more than it helps during war as
the USSR will be able to quickly conquer these countries and creating a
larger front for Germany to fight on.
