Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to
manoeuvre more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limited to
roads and so their performance may suffer in provinces with low
infrastructure levels.

##  Motorized Division Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades allowed 

-   [Anti-aircraft
    Brigade](/Anti-aircraft_Brigade "Anti-aircraft Brigade")
-   [Anti-Tank Brigade](/Anti-Tank_Brigade "Anti-Tank Brigade")
-   [Armored Car Brigade](/Armored_Car_Brigade "Armored Car Brigade")
-   [Artillery Brigade](/Artillery_Brigade "Artillery Brigade")

##  Notes 

-   Motorized divisions are considered soft units
-   Because of their high speed, they are the prime targets for adding
    to [Mechanized
    Divisions](/Mechanized_Division "Mechanized Division") or [Armored
    Divisions](/Armored_Division "Armored Division") in a 1:2 ratio, to
    get the combined arms bonus.
