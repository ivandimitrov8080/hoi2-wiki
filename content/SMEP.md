title: "SMEP"
---

SMEP leaves the core gameplay of Hearts of Iron II intact. However, some
things were not up to snuff. These are the things SMEP attempts to
address. Here are some examples...

SMEP has many peace treaty events. Infact, SMEP's work was so stable and
impressive that it was included (with typos) in later Hearts of Iron II
patches (see "Faith of China", which I meant to type as "Fate of
China"). Treaties include...

Soviet-Japanese War, Sino-Japanese War, Russian Civil War, Russo-German
War, German-American War, Japanese-American War, Franco-German War,
Romano-Hungarian War (included in later HOI patches), Romano-Bulgarian
War ...and more!

Other noteworthy event chains include...

Partition of Yugoslavia, Partition of Greece, Post-War Eastern Front
events, Post-War Western Front events.

SMEP includes what "capital capture" events to make the Allies and
Soviets war against the Nazis competitive! Americans in Budapest? Ally
Hungary after the war! Soviets in Denmark? Set up a puppet regime in
Copenhagen! This creates a very worthwhile experience; you are rewarded
for your actions!

SMEP now includes the Consolidated China Improvement Pack, which is
altered to fit SMEP's needs and goals. Thank you to the team!
