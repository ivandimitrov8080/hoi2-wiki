##  Introduction 

Cuba is small island nation low on IC and does not have much influence
in the world. You can change that by expanding to the Americas and
taking all of the Caribbean islands that hold something important.

##  Starting off 

At the beginning don't worry about IC. You will need up to 7 infantry
divisions, 6 transports and some convoys, so quickly create them using
the little IC you have. It would be smart to build some smaller boats to
defend them but that is not required. When you're done you will be in a
strange time period where all the wars will begin. You're going to have
to conquer a lot to become a threat to Europe and the United States.

##  Technology 

Since your nation is weak, you should only concentrate on infantry.
Also, don't forget to work on new artillery. In the beginning you will
only have 1 tech slot but in the future you will have more.

##  Influence 

Work on influencing the Axis because your future is there and you will
need about +120 to join during war time. You can change the world by
joining them, even though you're tiny. In the end you will have many
puppets and you'll become one of the major Axis leaders.

  

##  Strategy 

###  Dominican Republic 

The Dominican Republic has 2 provinces and that will help. Declare war
on them and land 6 infantry divisions in the north. Now hit the rest of
the Dominican Republic. You'll have to annex the nation before the US
cancels the non-aggression pact with you. If you don't have any
transports, retreat your armies up to Cuba and build some. Now make 1
factory on your main island. Build some militia if you have some extra
IC. It will gain experience with your infantry.

###  Haiti 

Once you can supply troops in the Dominican Republic you can declare war
on Haiti. Move all your troops to the southern province and let them
take the upper province which will spread the units and then attack
Port-au-Prince an take it. Then annex. You now control 2 major
provinces. You have to move quickly before the US cancels their
non-aggression pact with you. Continue to spam infantry.

###  Central America 

Central American nations are rich in terms of IC which can help. Hit El
Salvador and annex it. Then take Guatemala. This only takes 10 units at
this stage. Quickly rush to Costa Rica and liberate Central America as a
nation and let them spam troops. Once they have around 4-5 divisions,
move your troops around because your next move will change the world.

###  Alliances 

Once it is 1939 you should join the Axis and grab all of the Dutch,
French and British colonies in the Americas and liberate them as
puppets. Keep Jamaica though. This area isn't defended. Take military
control of your allies and take over France and then London. This will
end the war early but you can't rush into this. To take the main island,
you'll need about 50 infantry divisions. Taking military control over
Germany is also very helpful. Land in Dover and sweep around the
islands. Don't liberate Scotland, England, or Wales, or the UK surrender
event wont happen. Now you move all your units to Africa and conquer it.
Then prepare to fight the Soviets.

###    What's next 

The US won't declare war on you unless you declare war on them, which
you can do with all the units from your puppets. You will probably need
to buy a colony from Italy that is worth something, in case the US
overrun you. You will use all your armies against the Soviets because
you don't need to defend the French coast so you'll have extra armies to
spare. You can also liberate all the British colonies and then you will
be stocked with puppets.
