##  Overview 

For a micro power, Bhutan is as good as any. An outdated army, not much
IC or resources, little room to expand. But being a puppet of the UK has
its perks, and there are some options to go for if you're looking to
expand.

##  Technology 

One research slot, one tech team. Even worse, it's terrible at
industrial techs and not exactly top notch at infantry either. However
it does do land doctrines well (as well as you can expect from a skill
level 1 team, at least), and if you plan to stick with the UK (or ally
with Japan later on) then it's best to go for Grand Battle Plan. You
start with no industrial or doctrine techs at all, and great war
equipment for your troops.

##  Diplomacy 

Bhutan starts as a puppet to the UK, and thus is a part of the allies.
Interesting options later on include going with Japan (if you want to
grab parts of India) or even try to get something going with the USSR.
Being a paternal autocrat could help if you want to ally with Germany,
but they won't be sending you any help and it generally is a terrible
idea. Overall, you won't be having the kind of money to turn bad
relations good, so sticking with the UK is a good, albeit boring, plan.

##  Economy 

You start with 5 IC, and a surplus of energy and metal barely worth
mentioning. If you want to trade, you'll have to use the little money
gained from being locked into a high consumer goods production or use IC
to make supplies.

##  Intelligence 

You might have a little extra cash, but nowhere near the amount you need
to get useful results out of spying. Get your blueprints from the UK
instead.

##  Armed forces 

You start with two 1918 infantry divisions, and with a manpower growth
of 6.4 per year there's not much you can do about that. After a couple
years of IC and manpower techs you'll be able to field an army of a few
infantry divisions and some milita. A navy and an air force is pretty
much out of the question. You don't have any coast, no air field, and
not the means to produce anything capable of hurting anyone. World
conquest material, it ain't.

##  Strategy 

Build up, go for Tibet (which is as weak as you, but without any allies)
and prepare to fight the Japs, or wait for the Japanese to make a push
for India, ally with them and start grabbing provinces. There's plenty
of resources to the south, and IC to the west and east. Annexing Nepal
is a must, and the manpower in Lucknow would certainly be welcome. All
in all, a successful alliance with Japan could triple your IC, manpower
and resources.
