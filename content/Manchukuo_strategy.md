##  Background 

[Manchukuo](/Manchukuo "Manchukuo") starts as a
[Puppet](/index.php?title=Puppet&action=edit&redlink=1 "Puppet (page does not exist)")
state, created as a slave of [Japan](/Japan "Japan") . But Japan's
success could lead to opportunities for your own "Empire".

##  Walkthrough for 1936 Scenario 

###  Preparing for War 

**Important Research** (Note: Manchuria has terrible tech teams, but can
rely on Japanese blueprints. You may be stuck with 1930s technology well
into the 1940s, just do what you can do.)

-   All agriculture: More manpower = more infantry.
-   Industrial: More industry = more infantry.
-   Infantry: Focus on infantry and supply technologies. If you can,
    cavalry and mountain troops.
-   Armor and Artillery: Develop artillery only. If your manage to get 3
    tech teams, build

**Trades**

-   Japan: Your one and only resourceful ally, get technologies from
    them. They will offer you free resources.
-   Thailand: An okay ally, trade to prop up a fellow desperate Great
    East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere nation.

###  1936-37 

Focus purely on industries. Make sacrifices to all other production for
this. It is preferable to have 40 IC but if this becomes unrealistic,
above 30 is fine.

Politics-wise, shift around your ministers to increase your IC and
Industrial research. Pu Yi helps to fight dissent.

###  Sino-Japan War 

When your venture into mass industrialization is complete, focus on
building entirely infantry and modern cavalry. Do not bother doing this
if you're still at a 1918 level.

As a puppet state, a stronger Japan means a stronger Manchuria. Help the
Japanese invasion as much as possible, hold strong positions, charge
into weak positions. Be as aggressive as possible with the Chinese; if
you're lucky, Nationalist China will be defeated or at least stuck in a
tough position.

During this period, don't bother with a Navy or Air Force. Though it
would display that you're a real country, with your technology they
would be useless.

To give you an edge in the war, shift your military leaders to give you
an infantry bonus.

When Mengchukuo is created and has a good amount of troops, take control
of their army. If a stalemate ever occurs, they can help relieve your
attack forces from defending a position.

By the time 1939 rolls around, you can try to upgrade all your infantry
to 1939 quality. It would be preferable and would guarantee a somewhat
modern army for years to come.

###  Pacific War 

By the time 1941 rolls around, you should have a massive army of brute
strength.

If you wish to help out in the Japanese conquest of Asia, build a Naval
Base and transports. Don't bother building up a strong naval force, it's
too late to research Naval technology or at least the Great War ships.
You might as well have a raft armed with firecrackers.

I recommend you help the invasion of South East Asia or the Philippeans.
You don't want to stretch your supply line too thin by sending your
armies deep into the Pacific.

Now, the American AI is very sporadic and not realistic sometimes. The
Manchurian coasts are in constant threat of invasion which could spell
certain doom for you. Unless you can afford a large coastal/land
fortress network, I recommend you keep several divisons in Manchukuo as
a defense force. The Americans will never send more then a few divisions
thanks to the Japanese Navy. If you have up-to-date Garrisons, build
them across your coast prior to the war.

By this time, the German invasion of Russia has begun. Sit back, fight
the Chinese (or Americans), and cheer for a German victory.

Starting in 1941 or as early as 1940, begin replacing your troops in
China with troops from Mengchukuo. You don't want to remove your
presence so much that the Chinese will begin overpowering the Japanese,
however. Move your troops to the Siberian and Mongolian borders.

###  Japanese-Soviet War 

This is it, what you've been building up for all these years. When the
Germans overrun Moscow/Caucasus (1942/1943) and things look grim for our
Red Friends, declare war on the Soviet Union. The sooner you DOW the
Comintern, the more land you can sieze from the Soviets. The Great
Manchurian Empire must expand at the price of the Soviets. Make sure you
are strong enough to attack eariler on, worst case scenario wait until
the Germans reach the Soviet Far East and expand into the remains.

First attack, Blitzkrieg throughout Mongolia. Do not use your troops
from Mengchukuo to help. Make sure you have a large enough army to race
Japan for Mongolia, don't let them take any useful lands for themselves.
If you have cavalry or tanks, use them here. Do not use any divisions
with artillery, it will slow you down. When Mongolia falls, [Tannu
Tuva](/Tannu_Tuva "Tannu Tuva") will be a piece of cake.

In the Soviet Far East, use 40% of your armies against Vladivostok and
neighboring provinces. Make sure to also strike further on into every
province bordering yours. As a sign of thier looming defeat to Germany,
the Soviets should be very weak. Don't be as hostile to Japanese help in
this region.

If you're feeling lucky, you can attack the USSR as early as 1941, but
like Japan, you will be in a fight for your life if you attack earlier.

You may find yourself overwhelmed by Soviet territory and sporadic
resistance, do not bother taking over regions with terrible
infrastructure and low resources. Only do this if there are large armies
to encircle. If you conquer Mongolia, send your large Mongolian armies
directly to Central Asia. It is loosly guarded and contains the Soviet
Industries moved from the West during the start of Barbarossa. Good news
for your IC, bad news for Russia's. With these captured, it will be the
USSR's death sentance.

Another event you need to be worried about is the Bitter Peace event.
Not that you have a choice, just hope it doesn't happen or you will lose
almost everything.

###    Whats next for Manchukuo? 

Help Japan defeat its enemies in Asia. If you haven't already, finish of
the Chinese (by this time, they should be in a very difficult position)
and British India. If Japan hasn't touched Australia or New Zealand and
your navy is up for the challenge, you could invade both countries.
