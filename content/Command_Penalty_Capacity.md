##    Command Penalty Capacity (i.e. the -75% penalty) 

1.  When you group your armies its essential that you understand that
    each leader has a Command Penalty Capacity (CPC).
2.  This is a parameter for each stack. It is worked out separately for
    each stack. Stack is defined above as the number of units/divisions
    in a province.
3.  If the total number of units in the stack exceeds the Command
    Penalty Capacity when attacking, then the excess units in that stack
    receive a -75% penalty.
4.  For each attacking stack, it is the capacity of the most senior
    leader in the stack.
    -   if the most senior leader is an FM, then it is 12
    -   if the most senior leader is an GEN, then it is 9
    -   if the most senior leader is an LT, then it is 3
    -   if the most senior leader is an MJ, then it is 1
5.  For a defending stack it is the sum of all the leaders present in
    the stack. (Unless you are being attacked by aircraft- according to
    the manual defence from aircraft is handled as per attack- each
    stack is assessed individually)
6.  Thus if we have 13 units in an attacking formation commanded by a FM
    (display of 13/12), one unit will have a -75% penalty. If the units
    were defending the display would also read 13/12. If we have 13
    units units in a territory, but 12 of them will be under a FM and
    the 13th will be under a LT and the stack was attacking (from one
    territory) then the display would read 13/12 - the 13th unit would
    be at -75%. If the same units were defending then the CPC will be 15
    (FM 12 + LT 3 = display 13/15) thus no unit will get a -75% penalty,
    but ONLY if they are defending.
7.  The stack capacity for all the formations in a province may be
    doubled by an HQ adjacent or in the same province. The HQ does not
    have to be present at the start of the combat - as soon as the HQ
    becomes adjacent to or present at an existing combat, the combat
    efficiency values alter accordingly.
    -   if the most senior leader is an FM, stack capacity is doubled to
        24
    -   if the most senior leader is an GEN, stack capacity is doubled
        to 18
    -   if the most senior leader is an LT, stack capacity doubled to 6
    -   if the most senior leader is an MJ, stack capacity is doubled to
        2

    1.  Note that stack capacity and formation capacity are different
        things as explained below in the HQ, skills, and traits section.
8.  Thus in the same situation, but with a HQ present as one of those 13
    units, we would have a CPC of 24 if one formation was commanded by a
    FM, and a CPC of 30, if a second formation was commanded by a LT. No
    unit will get the -75% penalty command capacity penalty.
9.  The units receiving the penalty are the lowest ones in the formation
    list for a stack.
10. There is a limit to the number of ATTACKERS in one stack - 24 per
    territory (under an FM with a HQ present - 18 if the highest is a
    general with HQ and so on). If there is no HQ in the area then the
    CPC will be max 12/FM, 9/G, 3LT & 1MJ. So in the above example if 13
    units (12 for FM and 1 LT) attacked from one province with a HQ the
    display will read 13/24.
11. This means that if you attack with an FM+23 units from one
    direction, and an FM+25 units from another direction, the combat
    screen will show 48/48 (if a HQ is present/nearby province), but in
    fact one of your units will get a -75% penalty.
12. There is no limit to the amount of DEFENDERS in the stack as long as
    you have enough command capacity to cover all the units.
13. There is no extra benefit for NOT using the full CPC - i.e. placing
    9 units under a FM (9/12).
