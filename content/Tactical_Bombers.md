Tactical Bombers are medium-sized aircraft, larger than Fighters, yet
smaller than [Strategic Bombers](/Strategic_Bombers "Strategic Bombers")
, which are used primarily for delivering attacks against enemy ground
units such as Armour and Infantry. Unlike close air support aircraft, it
is also capable of taking up limited strategic bombardment roles, such
as runway cratering or strikes against defensive installations. Although
they have a limited dog-fighting capability, they can be easily
outmatched by Fighters in air combat.
