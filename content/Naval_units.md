[Template:Anthology](/index.php?title=Template:Anthology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Anthology (page does not exist)")
All units representing ships and that need to be deployed in [naval
bases](/index.php?title=Naval_base&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naval base (page does not exist)")
. Ships cannot upgrade to newer models, once researched. The only
exception is that the [CAG](/Carrier_Air_Group "Carrier Air Group") of a
[Carrier](/Carrier "Carrier") can upgrade to newer models, but not the
carrier vessel itself.

##  Naval brigades 

[Armageddon](/Armageddon "Armageddon") introduced naval brigades, to
allow ships to be upgraded.

-   [Carrier Air Group](/Carrier_Air_Group "Carrier Air Group") (CAG).
    This brigade exists in all versions of HoI. They represent the
    planes of carrier. Only a CV can hold this brigade and no other ship
    may.

All capital ships except a CV and a CVL may hold any of these brigades.
