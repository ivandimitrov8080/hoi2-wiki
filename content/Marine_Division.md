    values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a normal
    infantry of the same year.
-   Marines have less penalty performing [amphibious
    assaults](/Amphibious_assault "Amphibious assault") (the penalty is
    reduced even more the further along the tech tree you get) .
-   Marines have less difficulties fighting in marshes and jungles.
