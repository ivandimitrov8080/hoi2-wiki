Garrison Divisions (Gar) are second line troops used to safeguard
valuable objectives far from the front lines. They lack heavy equipment
and transportation, making them immobile except for strategic
redeployment. They have limited fighting capability but can be used to
free more capable troops for frontline use.

##  Garrison Division Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades allowed 

-   [Anti-aircraft
    Brigade](/Anti-aircraft_Brigade "Anti-aircraft Brigade")
-   [Anti-Tank Brigade](/Anti-Tank_Brigade "Anti-Tank Brigade")
-   [Artillery Brigade](/Artillery_Brigade "Artillery Brigade")
-   [Engineer Brigade](/Engineer_Brigade "Engineer Brigade")
-   [Police Brigade](/Police_Brigade "Police Brigade")
-   [Rocket Artillery

##  Notes 

-   Garrison divisions are considered soft units.
-   Garrison's have one job: Partisan Suppression.
-   Using Garrison's for anything else is usually either a desperate act
    or a misuse of troops. Garrison's should be measured on one thing,
    their *Suppresion* ability. Garrison '39 are the most cost effective
    at doing this. Unless you know that you are going to need Partisan
    Suppression, you don't need Garrison Divisions.
