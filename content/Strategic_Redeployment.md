####    How do I strategically redeploy units? 

The following requirements must be satisfied for Strategic Redeployment
(SR):

-   Rear Area Supply Dumps (an Infantry tech) is researched.
-   There is a land connection between the current location of division
    and the target.

Select the unit(s). Hold ctrl + right click in the destination province.
For garrisons, a simple right click will do.

-   NOTE: you can not SR thru an ally's territory unless you are at war.

&nbsp;

-   NOTE: As a general rule it is longer, in time, to SR one provience
    distance but shorter, in time, to SR 2 or more proviences away.
