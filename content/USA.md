##  Overview 

The United States is perhaps the easiest nation to play. The USA is
separated from hostile nations by two huge oceans, and it also has the
highest industrial capacity of all nations. The resource production of
the USA is the best in the game as well, with enough resources to supply
the nation's entire industrial base even after considerable growth. For
these reasons, a player can choose nearly any strategy with the USA for
a successful game.

The USA starts with a solid navy, but is exceedingly weak in most other
regards. The army is a skeleton crew, the airforce moderate and starting
tech poor (aside from industrial and naval). Worse, isolationist
policies hamstring the nation and lock you into a high percent of
consumer goods production. Your industrial base is massive and has even
greater potentital, plus you have the resources on your home soil to
properly exploit industrial expansion . Your tech teams are excellent,
allowing you to pursue several possible strategic avenues. The USA has
the potential to do just about anything you want.

##  Technology 

The USA has some of the best research teams in the world, second only to
Germany overall. The US does start significantly behind other major
nations in starting technologies, however. The US land doctrine of
Superior Firepower is one of the worst trees possible, becoming truly
effectively only after 1944. Some players may choose to abandon this
tree for that reason, however doing so could be considered
[gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") since the US is tremendously
overpowered in every other respect. By August, 1937, it is possible for
the USA to have researched *every* 1936 and 1937 technology.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

The USA has various alliance possibilities. The most obvious alliance is
with the Allies, however a Fascist USA or a Communist USA are possible.

###  Sliders 

The USA's weakest point are its political sliders. The USA begins the
game with only one positive slider position: Free Market. The sliders
for Drafted Army, Dove Lobby, and Isolationism are all set to the
extreme worst position.

###  Ministers 

Total slider moves by events: Drafted Army:-1 Hawk: +10
Interventionism:+8

##  Intelligence 

The USA creates more money than any other nation in the game, making it
particularly well suited for the Intelligence system. The counter-point,
however, is the the US open society causes severe penalties for spying.

##  Economy 

###  Trading 

The USA does not have to exert any effort in trading. It is fairly easy
for the USA not only to have all of its supplies paid for by trading,
but even to amass a daily stockpile increase of +20 supplies or more
after just the first two months in the game. With enough industrial
expansion (around +10 IC), the USA will be short of Rare Materials.
These are very easy to trade for via the UK or the USSR, and the best
trade good to use is money, since the USA produces huge amounts.

###  Industrial Production 

In the early years of the game, the USA has very little use for its IC
other than ship building and IC building. While IC spamming is certainly
possible, the USA begins the game with over 100 more IC than any other
nation. Therefore, a balance of IC building and naval building is
recommended. An early starting run of 4 - 6 IC provides a fairly good
balance.

##  Military 

###  Army 

The USA can field a modern army that combines large numbers of high cost
units. Armor, Motorized, Mechanized, Marines, Mountain, Infantry and
brigades can all be buit and should be built. Usually, the USA does not
need to, nor can it, start building large numbers of Armor and Motor
prior to '40-'41. Instead, it should focus on developing and deploying
the most modern Marine and Mountain units. But do not fail to build some
Armor and Motor. It's better to have a handful on hand than to be stuck
playing catchup. Further, every nation needs Infantry and to neglect
them is to weaken yourself. For the USA, they are important early on for
garrison work and later on for holding those islands. Fancy units like
Armor, Motor, Mountain and Marines take the ground, but Infantry hold
it. Later, the bulk of your army should be composed of Motorized
Infantry. These units are perfect for the US and the US can afford to
build them in large numbers. In most games I shoot for 40 Motorized
divisions and continue to build them till the end of the game. Armor is
critical as well, and I often field 20+ armored division. Mechinized are
useful, but are best used in conjunction with the Mechanized Assualt
doctrine.

###  Navy 

The United States begins the game with an enormous Navy (112 ships in
total), that probably ranks about third in terms of total strength
(beneath Japan and the UK). Many of these ships, however, are obsolete
level one destroyers that are best disbanded at the beginning of the
game, along with one level-one battleship, the Arkansas, and the 5th and
6th submarine divisions, particularly the latter two. You could probably
also part with the early heavy cruisers, since you also have the basic
model. In ARMA you can give a maximum of five such ships to a nation
that you might have a "soft spot" for. (With this contributor that
nation is [Shanxi](/Shanxi "Shanxi") , and through a series of
admittedly [gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") moves I've had Shanxi
use those ships in the early European war.) The submarine divisions
mentioned are level 1 dive boats and are of questionable value even for
micro and minor powers. With the slowest speed and shortest range of any
naval vessels, they'll hinder anything else they're attached to. The USA
also begins the game with level four Battleship technology, thus early
Battleship building is wise for the creation of powerful [Surface Action
Groups](/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") . An early
production run of convoys (99 serial) is also essential, since the USA
will rely very heavily on convoys. The mainstay of the United States
Navy, however, is its carrier superiority, or [Carrier Taskforce
Fleet](/Carrier_Task_Force "Carrier Task Force") . A powerful CTF is
essential in HOI2, but with the introduction of the CVL (light carrier)
in DD and ARMA, the United States could rule the seas with SAGs.

###  Air Force 

The USA can build an extremely powerful Air Force if desired. As is the
case with every nation, TAC and CAS are extremely effective units. STRAT
is not usually useful in the game, but for the USA can be used to
deliver nukes and bomb the Japanese mainland, for example, into
submission.

##  Events 

###  Election of 1936 

-   Roosevelt: Dissent -2, Manpower +20.
-   Landon: Political Right set to 2, Isolationism +1, Dissent +2; +10
    IC.

###  Revolution 

If the USA ever gets 65 dissent or higher, a revolution event will fire
and the player can choose either a Communist or Socialist government.

###  Pitman Act: Assistance to China 

This will occur after the Japanese invasion of China, around July 1,
1937. In HoI2, the Japanese will never take over China. In DD and ARMA,
the Japanese will always defeat China. The US has two options:

-   Pass the Act: -1000 supplies.
-   Do not Pass the Act: +1 isolationism

###  Nanking Massacre 

Around the winter of 1937, the Japanese will likely capture Nanking,
causing the event to fire. The USA gains +1 interventionism.

###  Panay Incident 

In May, 1939, Japanese vessels will sink a US warship in China. The USA
will receive money +500, and dissent +1.

###  Gearing up for War 

**After the Dutch capitulation, typically in May, 1940:**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +3 Hawk, +200 Manpower, Peace time modified
    by +25%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**After the German attack on the Soviet Union:**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +1 Hawk, +1 Isolationism, +100 Manpower,
    Peace time modified by +15%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**August, 1941**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +1 Hawk, +1 Isolationism, +100 Manpower,
    Peace time modified by +15%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**Destroyers for Bases** In the Summer of 1940 this event will fire.

-   Sign the Agreement: +5 manpower, -50 convoy escorts
-   We need these ships: +1 isolationism

**Presidential Election: 1940'**

-   Roosevelt: Dissent -2; Manpower +10.
-   Wilkie: Change of government

**There is one more thing, the Japanese surprise attack. This has to be
added but one caveat, I have seen the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl
have two different values:**

The Japanese Surprise attack on Pearl Harbor can sometimes NOT happen,
so do not depend on it. The AI seems to usually pick it but I have had a
few games where it has not done this at all. This is true in all three
versions (HOI2, DD, Arma). For multiplayer purposes, the way it works is
that the Japanse player gets the war with the US thru one event and then
after the war fires, the Japanese player gets another event with the
option to do the Surprise attack.

**Normal Japanese Surprise attack on Pearl Harbor:**

-   +2 Hawk, +3 Intervention

**Occasional value for the same attack (not sure what modifies it, maybe
random chance?):**

-   +3 Hawk, +4 Intervention

###  Arsenal of Democracy 

Occurs when the USA goes to war with Germany (likely around December
1941 or later):

-   Pass the Act: -5000 supplies, -2500 oil, -2500 metal.
    Interventionism +1. Provides considerable help to the Allies.
-   Remain Completely Neutral: Isolationism +1

###  Lend Lease Act 

This event provides considerable help to the UK and the USSR.

-   Pass the Act: -5000 Supplies, -2500 Oil, -2500 Metal
-   Don't Pass: +1 Isolationism

##  War 

###  War with Japan 

Around December, 1941, Japan will DOW on the USA. The war against Japan
is extremely easy: Japan does not defend its main land. A US player that
has planned a modest invasion force of marines can occupy the Japanese
mainland and cripple Japan. That is not however, terribly fun. Most
players will instead refrain from building Marines or a serious army
before Pearl Harbor. After that point, they will follow the historical
route of intensive naval battles. Then, naval hopping to every single
island in the Pacific, until landings in China combined with an attack
on the mainland.

###  War with Germany 

War with Germany is also quite easy, mainly since it does not defend its
Atlantic wall. Most players will instead travel through North Africa and
Italy, proceeded by an invasion of France.

##  Gaming the System 

A player of the USA can use a litany of [gamey
tactics](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") , including:

-   Early declaration of war to erase the IC penalties
-   Early to join the Allies, and help research

recommended. An early starting run of 4 - 6 IC provides a fairly good
balance.

##  Military 

###  Army 

The USA can field a modern army that combines large numbers of high cost
units. Armor, Motorized, Mechanized, Marines, Mountain, Infantry and
brigades can all be buit and should be built. Usually, the USA does not
need to, nor can it, start building large numbers of Armor and Motor
prior to '40-'41. Instead, it should focus on developing and deploying
the most modern Marine and Mountain units. But do not fail to build some
Armor and Motor. It's better to have a handful on hand than to be stuck
playing catchup. Further, every nation needs Infantry and to neglect
them is to weaken yourself. For the USA, they are important early on for
garrison work and later on for holding those islands. Fancy units like
Armor, Motor, Mountain and Marines take the ground, but Infantry hold
it. Later, the bulk of your army should be composed of Motorized
Infantry. These units are perfect for the US and the US can afford to
build them in large numbers. In most games I shoot for 40 Motorized
divisions and continue to build them till the end of the game. Armor is
critical as well, and I often field 20+ armored division. Mechinized are
useful, but are best used in conjunction with the Mechanized Assualt
doctrine.

###  Navy 

The United States begins the game with an enormous Navy (112 ships in
total), that probably ranks about third in terms of total strength
(beneath Japan and the UK). Many of these ships, however, are obsolete
level one destroyers that are best disbanded at the beginning of the
game, along with one level-one battleship, the Arkansas, and the 5th and
6th submarine divisions, particularly the latter two. You could probably
also part with the early heavy cruisers, since you also have the basic
model. In ARMA you can give a maximum of five such ships to a nation
that you might have a "soft spot" for. (With this contributor that
nation is [Shanxi](/Shanxi "Shanxi") , and through a series of
admittedly [gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") moves I've had Shanxi
use those ships in the early European war.) The submarine divisions
mentioned are level 1 dive boats and are of questionable value even for
micro and minor powers. With the slowest speed and shortest range of any
naval vessels, they'll hinder anything else they're attached to. The USA
also begins the game with level four Battleship technology, thus early
Battleship building is wise for the creation of powerful [Surface Action
Groups](/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") . An early
production run of convoys (99 serial) is also essential, since the USA
will rely very heavily on convoys. The mainstay of the United States
Navy, however, is its carrier superiority, or [Carrier Taskforce
Fleet](/Carrier_Task_Force "Carrier Task Force") . A powerful CTF is
essential in HOI2, but with the introduction of the CVL (light carrier)
in DD and ARMA, the United States could rule the seas with SAGs.

###  Air Force 

The USA can build an extremely powerful Air Force if desired. As is the
case with every nation, TAC and CAS are extremely effective units. STRAT
is not usually useful in the game, but for the USA can be used to
deliver nukes and bomb the Japanese mainland, for example, into
submission.

##  Events 

###  Election of 1936 

-   Roosevelt: Dissent -2, Manpower +20.
-   Landon: Political Right set to 2, Isolationism +1, Dissent +2; +10
    IC.

###  Revolution 

If the USA ever gets 65 dissent or higher, a revolution event will fire
and the player can choose either a Communist or Socialist government.

###  Pitman Act: Assistance to China 

This will occur after the Japanese invasion of China, around July 1,
1937. In HoI2, the Japanese will never take over China. In DD and ARMA,
the Japanese will always defeat China. The US has two options:

-   Pass the Act: -1000 supplies.
-   Do not Pass the Act: +1 isolationism

###  Nanking Massacre 

Around the winter of 1937, the Japanese will likely capture Nanking,
causing the event to fire. The USA gains +1 interventionism.

###  Panay Incident 

In May, 1939, Japanese vessels will sink a US warship in China. The USA
will receive money +500, and dissent +1.

###  Gearing up for War 

**After the Dutch capitulation, typically in May, 1940:**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +3 Hawk, +200 Manpower, Peace time modified
    by +25%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**After the German attack on the Soviet Union:**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +1 Hawk, +1 Isolationism, +100 Manpower,
    Peace time modified by +15%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**August, 1941**

-   Prepare for War: +3 IC, +1 Hawk, +1 Isolationism, +100 Manpower,
    Peace time modified by +15%.
-   These measures are not needed: +1 dove; +50 manpower

**Destroyers for Bases** In the Summer of 1940 this event will fire.

-   Sign the Agreement: +5 manpower, -50 convoy escorts
-   We need these ships: +1 isolationism

**Presidential Election: 1940'**

-   Roosevelt: Dissent -2; Manpower +10.
-   Wilkie: Change of government

**There is one more thing, the Japanese surprise attack. This has to be
added but one caveat, I have seen the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl
have two different values:**

The Japanese Surprise attack on Pearl Harbor can sometimes NOT happen,
so do not depend on it. The AI seems to usually pick it but I have had a
few games where it has not done this at all. This is true in all three
versions (HOI2, DD, Arma). For multiplayer purposes, the way it works is
that the Japanse player gets the war with the US thru one event and then
after the war fires, the Japanese player gets another event with the
option to do the Surprise attack.

**Normal Japanese Surprise attack on Pearl Harbor:**

-   +2 Hawk, +3 Intervention

**Occasional value for the same attack (not sure what modifies it, maybe
random chance?):**

-   +3 Hawk, +4 Intervention

###  Arsenal of Democracy 

Occurs when the USA goes to war with Germany (likely around December
1941 or later):

-   Pass the Act: -5000 supplies, -2500 oil, -2500 metal.
    Interventionism +1. Provides considerable help to the Allies.
-   Remain Completely Neutral: Isolationism +1

###  Lend Lease Act 

This event provides considerable help to the UK and the USSR.

-   Pass the Act: -5000 Supplies, -2500 Oil, -2500 Metal
-   Don't Pass: +1 Isolationism

##  War 

###  War with Japan 

Around December, 1941, Japan will DOW on the USA. The war against Japan
is extremely easy: Japan does not defend its main land. A US player that
has planned a modest invasion force of marines can occupy the Japanese
mainland and cripple Japan. That is not however, terribly fun. Most
players will instead refrain from building Marines or a serious army
before Pearl Harbor. After that point, they will follow the historical
route of intensive naval battles. Then, naval hopping to every single
island in the Pacific, until landings in China combined with an attack
on the mainland.

###  War with Germany 

War with Germany is also quite easy, mainly since it does not defend its
Atlantic wall. Most players will instead travel through North Africa and
Italy, proceeded by an invasion of France.

##  Gaming the System 

A player of the USA can use a litany of [gamey
tactics](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") , including:

-   Early declaration of war to erase the IC penalties
-   Early to join the Allies, and help research

##  Overview 

The United States is perhaps the easiest nation to play. The USA is
separated from hostile nations by two huge oceans, and it also has the
highest industrial capacity of all nations. The resource production of
the USA is the best in the game as well, with enough resources to supply
the nation's entire industrial base even after considerable growth. For
these reasons, a player can choose nearly any strategy with the USA for
a successful game.

The USA starts with a solid navy, but is exceedingly weak in most other
regards. The army is a skeleton crew, the airforce moderate and starting
tech poor (aside from industrial and naval). Worse, isolationist
policies hamstring the nation and lock you into a high percent of
consumer goods production. Your industrial base is massive and has even
greater potentital, plus you have the resources on your home soil to
properly exploit industrial expansion . Your tech teams are excellent,
allowing you to pursue several possible strategic avenues. The USA has
the potential to do just about anything you want.

##  Technology 

The USA has some of the best research teams in the world, second only to
Germany overall. The US does start significantly behind other major
nations in starting technologies, however. The US land doctrine of
Superior Firepower is one of the worst trees possible, becoming truly
effectively only after 1944. Some players may choose to abandon this
tree for that reason, however doing so could be considered
[gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") since the US is tremendously
overpowered in every other respect. By August, 1937, it is possible for
the USA to have researched *every* 1936 and 1937 technology.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

The USA has various alliance possibilities. The most obvious alliance is
with the Allies, however a Fascist USA or a Communist USA are possible.

###  Sliders 

The USA's weakest point are its political sliders. The USA begins the
game with only one positive slider position: Free Market. The sliders
for Drafted Army, Dove Lobby, and Isolationism are all set to the
extreme worst position.

###  Ministers 

Total slider moves by events: Drafted Army:-1 Hawk: +10
Interventionism:+8

##  Intelligence 

The USA creates more money than any other nation in the game, making it
particularly well suited for the Intelligence system. The counter-point,
however, is the the US open society causes severe penalties for spying.

##  Economy 

###  Trading 

The USA does not have to exert any effort in trading. It is fairly easy
for the USA not only to have all of its supplies paid for by trading,
but even to amass a daily stockpile increase of +20 supplies or more
after just the first two months in the game. With enough industrial
expansion (around +10 IC), the USA will be short of Rare Materials.
These are very easy to trade for via the UK or the USSR, and the best
trade good to use is money, since the USA produces huge amounts.

###  Industrial Production 

In the early years of the game, the USA has very little use for its IC
other than ship building and IC building. While IC spamming is certainly
possible, the USA begins the game with over 100 more IC than any other
nation. Therefore, a balance of IC building and naval building is
recommended. An early starting run of 4 - 6 IC provides a fairly good
balance.

##  Military 

###  Army 

The USA can field a modern army that combines large numbers of high cost
units. Armor, Motorized, Mechanized, Marines, Mountain, Infantry and
brigades can all be buit and should be built. Usually, the USA does not
need to, nor can it, start building large numbers of Armor and Motor
prior to '40-'41. Instead, it should focus on developing and deploying
the most modern Marine and Mountain units. But do not fail to build some
Armor and Motor. It's better to have a handful on hand than to be stuck
playing catchup. Further, every nation needs Infantry and to neglect
them is to weaken yourself. For the USA, they are important early on for
garrison work and later on for holding those islands. Fancy units like
Armor, Motor, Mountain and Marines take the ground, but Infantry hold
it. Later, the bulk of your army should be composed of Motorized
Infantry. These units are perfect for the US and the US can afford to
build them in large numbers. In most games I shoot for 40 Motorized
divisions and continue to build them till the end of the game. Armor is
critical as well, and I often field 20+ armored division. Mechinized are
useful, but are best used in conjunction with the Mechanized Assualt
doctrine.

###  Navy 

The United States begins the game with an enormous Navy (112 ships in
total), that probably ranks about third in terms of total strength
(beneath Japan and the UK). Many of these ships, however, are obsolete
level one destroyers that are best disbanded at the beginning of the
game, along with one level-one battleship, the Arkansas, and the 5th and
6th submarine divisions, particularly the latter two. You could probably
also part with the early heavy cruisers, since you also have the basic
model. In ARMA you can give a maximum of five such ships to a nation
that you might have a "soft spot" for. (With this contributor that
nation is [Shanxi](/Shanxi "Shanxi") , and through a series of
admittedly [gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") moves I've had Shanxi
use those ships in the early European war.) The submarine divisions
mentioned are level 1 dive boats and are of questionable value even for
micro and minor powers. With the slowest speed and shortest range of any
naval vessels, they'll hinder anything else they're attached to. The USA
also begins the game with level four Battleship technology, thus early
Battleship building is wise for the creation of powerful [Surface Action
Groups](/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") . An early
production run of convoys (99 serial) is also essential, since the USA
