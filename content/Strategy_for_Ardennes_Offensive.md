##  Allied Strategy 

The germans are very strong along the east/south east front and any
attack along this front will fail. Withdraw as many divisions as
possible from this front, leave about five divisions in each province.
Move this mobile reserve to the provinces behind Arnhem, this is where
the Germans will try to break through.

Forget any history lessons of the Battle of the Bulge, it doesn't play
out that way. You should have Patton commanding an army group in the
area around Arnhem with a large number of divisions available to exploit
an enemy weakness. Attack north when your forces are in position and
continue north as far as possible, hooking right into Germany and
cutting off the enemy armies.

The enemy will attack north from their positions in the east to retake
the territory you have occupied in Germany, you will need to keep your
forces positioned for mutual supporting roles in defending the conquered
territory.

##  German Strategy 

Your number one goal in this scenario (and the one that will almost
guarantee success) is to capture Antwerp. But instead of attacking
through the Ardennes, as happened historically, hit the the Allies in
the north at Arnhem from multiple directions. Continue to push south,
all the while using all you forces in multi-directional attacks, until
you link up with your 2 divisons in Dunkirk. By then victory should be
yours!
