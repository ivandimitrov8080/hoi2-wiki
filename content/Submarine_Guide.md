**Submarines** are a powerful unit in HOI2, which the AI finds very
difficult to use. Some players consider optimal use of submarines to be
a gamey exploit.

##  Surface Battles 

Many players consider that there is little historical justification for
such results. In World War Two, most submarines acted independently.
German 'wolfpack' attacks were generally made by less than a dozen
units, and only exceptionally by 20-30 submarines. Coordinating attacks
by a large number of submarines was, and remains, a difficult logistical
challenge.

A HOI submarine unit represents several (probably about 5) boats. For
this reason, many players consider that a stack of a dozen SS units (60
subs) is not only ahistorical but also unrealistic: a fleet of 60
submarines has not only never occurred but would be very difficult to
keep together and find a coordinated attack impossible.

Some players have suggested adjusting the stack limits for submarines to
adjust for this. As an interim solution some adopt a 'house rule' of a
maximum stack size for subs of two or three units.

##  Convoy Raiding 

Submarines can conduct convoy raiding attacks with considerable effect.
However, many AI countries, particularly large ones such as the UK,
build up very large stockpiles of all goods early in the game. This
considerably reduces the value of convoy raids, because industry can
continue even if no more resources are being imported. Historically, the
UK was on the verge of running out of some important goods at many times
thanks to sub attacks.

But even if submarines do not hurt the IC of a country directly, a
successful submarine campaign forces the victim to build convoys and
escorts so there is much less IC left for more dangerous stuff like
ships, planes and troops. Additionally, troops at oversea territories
donÂ´t get supplied and so starve to death or will be evacuated.

##  AI use 

As of version 1.3b, AI development and construction of submarines is
disabled. This is because developers felt that the AI was unable to use
its submarines effectively, and that switching off their development
would result in a more challenging game.

AI nations retain their existing sub fleets, but will build no more.

Players who want a game with a more historical naval construction plan
are advised to use patch 1.3a.

##  Quote from the HoI2 Lead Script AI Developer Lothos 

"..Subs are not supposed to be able to attack surface fleets head on...I
have my own house rule of no more than 6 subs in a fleet..."

##  Submarines in Hearts of Iron 2 

Submarines have a high Surface Attack value. A large stack of submarines
is often able to defeat a significant enemy surface fleet, sinking core
units like battleships and carriers. This is particularly true when
attacking at night, when submarine-based doctrines have been researched,
and when other attacks have reduced the number of destroyer and light
cruiser screens. Note that this is not true in Doomsday, where sub
surface attack values have been nerfed and a convoy attack value has
been added.

##  Submarines in [Doomsday](/Doomsday "Doomsday") 

Doomsday has seriously crippled the surface attack rating of submarines,
and has introduced the convoy attack rating to offset this. The convoy
attack rating is the same as the surface attack rating for all sea units
except for submarines, who have higher convoy attack ratings. Doomsday
also introduced Light Carriers with high sub attack ratings, and the ASW
upgrade for other ships.

This means that subs are no longer a viable option to destroy enemy
fleets. They are still useful for convoy raiding though, just remember
to pay attention to the battle menu, and retreat immediately when your
subs are engaged by a surface fleet. All in all, I have found Naval and
Tac bombers (flying from Spain) to be a better option for convoy raiding
in DD.

##  Submarines in [Armageddon](/Armageddon "Armageddon") 

###  Version 1.1 

Functionality essentially unchanged from Doomsday.

###  Version 1.2 

The Amageddon patch v1.2 changed submarine behavior from v1.1

-   Submarines do not remove [FOW](/FOW "FOW") in adjacent
    [land](/index.php?title=Land&action=edit&redlink=1 "Land (page does not exist)")
    areas
-   Small units (1 to 3) of submarines *seem* more vulnerable.
-   Large units (24+) of submarines *seem* more powerful.

In reviewing [Combat range](/Combat_range "Combat range") it becomes
apparent that submarines should be grouped into singular models.
Combining different model submarines will result in the whole fleet
attempting to fight at the range of the shortest range submarine.
