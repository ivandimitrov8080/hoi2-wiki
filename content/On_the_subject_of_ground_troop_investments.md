##  Introduction 

The subject of this analysis is to recommend what type of division
should make up the bulk of your Ground Self-Defense forces. For this,
different types of infantry were selected for analysis. However, since
motorized and mechanized infantry divisions are not available until
around 1940, the earlier forms of Infantry divisions were dropped from
the analysis. The later division types, mid-1940's, have also been
dropped since they make a rather late appearance.

\[Table 1 - Infantry '39, '41, '43, Motorized Infantry '40, '42 and
Mechanized Infantry '42, '43\]

  
From the table above, one can note no significant difference in
organization, morale, AA, AD, SA, HA and Manpower requirement. However,
slight differences can be noted in Toughness and Defensiveness in favor
of Infantry. However, the other division types are to a different extent
hard targets as well, and will thus require enemy units to use HA in
order to inflict damage. In regards to speed, Mechanized Infantry is
superior. Mechanized Infantry does however consume roughly 28Â % more
fuel than Motorized Infantry, whilst Infantry is far more economic in
both supply and has no fuel consumption. In regards to equipment,
Infantry is yet again the most economic choice, costing only half that
of the other two, when taking into account the extra month to field a
Mechanized Infantry division it becomes even more costly.

##  Geography and weather 

Moving on to suitability in different terrain types, Infantry shows
great versatility both when advancing and holding ground, and does not
suffer as much as the Motorized and Mechanized Infantry divisions do in
adverse terrain and weather conditions (although more specialized
divisions are a superior choice if available).

My conclusion is that although mechanized infantry should be strongly
favored when this type of division becomes available, there is no reason
not to field a large amount of ordinary infantry divisions since these
can also be used for counterinsurgency missions when mechanized infantry
shoulders more of the responsibility in offense that in the early era
('36-'40) is given to ordinary infantry divisions. Later in the game
mechanized infantry can be fielded in large quantities. However, due to
the flexible nature of footborne divisions, they should still be able to
remain the backbone of any army with the aid of panzer units, as well as
CAS and tactical airwings after air superiority has been established.

##  ToDos 

The tables are taken from elsewhere in this wiki, and contains data from
v1.1. It should be checked if the data is still correct in the latest
version.

PS This article was writen with a great power in mind. Some smaller
states might not find the conclusions suitable.
