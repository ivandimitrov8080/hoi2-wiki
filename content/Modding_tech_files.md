##  Introduction 

The structure of the tech files has changed quite a bit from HoI to HoI2
as the tech system has undergone big changes. However, the tech files
are still quite easy to mod.

  

##  Basic Structure 

The main structure of a tech file is a single tech application, like
"Early Infantry Division".

    application = { # Early Infantry Division
        id = 1020                                ID
        name = TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_NAME                      Name
        desc = TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_DESC

        position = { x = 24 y = 48 }                     Position
        year = 1936                              Year

        component = { # Service Rifle                        Components
                id = 1021
                name = TECH_CMP_INFANTRY_2_1_NAME
                type = general_equipment
                difficulty = 5
        }

        ##four more components

        required = { 1010 }                          Prerequisites
        effects = {                              Effects
            command = { type = new_model which = infantry value = 1 }
                command = { type = scrap_model which = infantry value = 0 }
                command = { type = activate_unit_type which = police }
        }
    }

  

###  ID 

Each tech has an ID which must be unique. It's convienent to use the IDs
the same way Paradox uses them. All IDs should have the following
structure:

The first digit should be a number between 1 and 9 to notify which tech
tree this tech belongs to. (1 = infantry, 2 = armor, 3 = naval, 4 =
aircraft, 5 = industry, 6 = land doctrines, 7 = secret weapons, 8 =
naval doctrines, 9 = air doctrines)

The next two digits should just be an integer counting the techs in the
file, e.g. "Early Infantry Division" is the second tech in the
*infantry_tech.txt* file and has 02 there.

The last digit should be a 0 for the application.

  

###  Name 

This specifies the tech name that appears ingame. This is language
specific and found in the *config/tech_names.csv* file.

Example:

       name = "TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_NAME"

The name can also be inserted right into the file. However, there is
also a short name for each tech found in *config/tech_names.csv* and
that is the one that'll be displayed on the buttons. It has the same
string name as the complete description prefixed with a "SHORT\_"

Example:

       name = "Basic Infantry Division"

The description is not used and is a relic from HoI1.

  

###  Position 

Position of the button in the tech tree measured in pixels from the
upper left corner of the tech tree graphic.

Example:

       position = { x = 24 y = 48 }

[Position measured in
pixels](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Techfiles_upperleftcorner_small.png "File:Techfiles upperleftcorner small.png")

You can define more than one position for each tech as is seen in the
Naval Doctrines screen. You just have to add another position clause for
each position.

  

###  Historical Year 

The historical year factors heavily into research if you try to get a
tech ahead of its historical date. Your research speed will be divided
by *(1 + d Ã— m)* with *d* being the number of days you are away from
January 1st of the historical year and *m* being the multiplier in
*misc.txt* . Researching one year ahead of time will give you a penalty
of 54%. Note however that this is calculated component-wise, so the
later components suffer less penalty than the earlier ones.

  

###  Components 

Each tech has five components.

Example:

    component = { # Great War Tank Prototype Tests
        id = 2015                ID
        name = TECH_CMP_ARMOR_1_5_NAME       Name
        type = technical_efficiency      Type
        difficulty = 5               Difficulty
        double_time = yes            Double Time
    }

####  Component ID 

Each tech component has an ID. The first three digits should be the same
as with the application the tech belongs to and the last digit should
count the components from 1 to 5.

####  Component Name 

This specifies the component name that appears ingame. This is language
specific and found in the *config/tech_names.csv* file.

Example:

       name = TECH_CMP_ARMOR_1_5_NAME

The name can also be inserted right into the file.

Example:

       name = "Great War Tank Prototype Tests"

Note quotes are only needed if you are inserting the text directly.
Strings should be quote-free (or so my testing has shown).

####  Component Type 

Each component has one of 34 different types. If a research team has
this [component
type](/List_of_Component_Types "List of Component Types") as speciality,
they'll research that component 50% faster than a team without it.

####  Component Difficulty 

Each component has a difficulty. This is a positive integer. While the
game out of the box only uses difficulties between 3 and 10, it is
possible to assign difficulties outside this interval. Note however that
difficulties are not linear so that difficulty 8 doesn't take twice as
much time as difficulty 4.

####  Double Time 

Double time does exactly what you would expect from its name. It doubles
the research time for the respective component. This is mainly used for
the prototypes of vehicles, ships and aircraft in the game out of the
box. If you don't want to double the time, just don't use this line.

###  Prerequisites 

The required clause lists the techs needed to research the tech in
question. These can be an empty set or you can list as many techs as you
want. However, as the game does not show tech interlinks between the
different pages and the indicator for needed techs on the same page is
easily overseen, you should modify the background picture for the tech
tree you are working in to show the dependencies.

Example: (Tech 1010 is required to research the tech in question)

    required = { 1010 }

You can also use a second type of this clause which will allow you to
make a set of prerequisites of which only one is needed. Note that this
can combined with necessary prerequisites. The required clause must
always be in, even if it is empty.

Example: (Tech 8160 is required and **one** of 8180 and 8080 is also
required)

    OR_required = { 8180 8080 }
    required = { 8160 }

  

###  Effects 

Each tech can have one or more effects.

Copy & Paste from *event commands.txt* (will format it later)

####  Chance of Combat Events 

There are seven commands (breakthrough, ambush, assault, counterattack,
delay, encirclement, tactical_withdrawal) to affect the chance of combat
events occurring. The value is additive.

Example:

    type = counterattack value = 4

This will increase the probability for a counterattack by 4%.

####  HQ effects 

#####  HQ Supply Efficiency Modifier 

The HQ divisions give a bonus on Supply Efficiency for all units in
adjactant provinces. This bonus can be changed by techs.

Example:

    type = hq_supply_eff value = X

Increases the Supply Efficiency bonus of HQs by X percent points.

type = sce_frequency value = X \# Combat event chance multiplier.
Default: 1.0

1.  Enable a certain type of mission

type = enable_task which = \[task type\]

1.  New models updates the current template for a division or brigade
    type.

command = { type = \[new_model\] which = \[division or brigade type\]
value = \[The model number\] }

1.  Make a division or brigade type available for construction.

command = { type = activate_unit_type which = \[division or brigade
type\] }

1.  Make a division or brigade type unavailable for construction.

command = { type = deactivate_unit_type which = \[division or brigade
type\] }

1.  ACTIVATE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY OF MISSILES

command = { type = nuclear_carrier which = \[flying_bomb/flying_rocket\]
}

1.  ACTIVATE MISSILE CAPABILITY OF SUBMARINES

command = { type = missile_carrier which = \[submarine\] }

1.  UNIT VALUES
2.  \[unit value\] =
    soft_attack/hard_attack/ground_defense/air_attack/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/max_organization/transport_weight/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/speed_cap_art/speed_cap_eng/speed_cap_at/speed_cap_aa
3.  

NOTE: I think some of these are out of date, I was modding around today
and "ground_defense" seems to have changed to "defensiveness". Others
might have changes aswell.

1.  Land unit bonuses

command = { type = \[unit value\] which = \[land/division type/brigade
type\] value = \[additive value modifier\] }

1.  Air unit bonuses

command = { type =
\[air_attack/strategic_attack/tactical_attack/naval_attack/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/surface_detection/air
detection/transport_capacity/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/range\]
which = \[air/division type/brigade type\] value = \[additive value
modifier\] }

1.  Naval unit bonuses

command = { type =
\[naval_attack/air_attack/shore_attack/naval_defense/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/surface_detection/air
detection/visibility/transport_capacity/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/range\]
which = \[naval/division type/brigade type\] value = \[additive value
modifier\] }

1.  NOTE: For "build_time" and "build_cost", it is possible to add the
    field "where = relative".
2.  This means that the value is parsed as a relative modifier (%)
    instead of an absolute addition.
3.  When doing this, THE BASE VALUE OF MODEL 0 IS USED FOR \_ALL\_
    MODELS. So "value = -10" means
4.  "-10% of the value of model 0".

&nbsp;

1.  
2.  UNIT COMBAT MODIFIERS
3.  
4.  Terrain combat modifiers

command = { type =

value = \[X\] \# Modifier in percent (+10 = 10%) }

1.  [Weather](/Weather "Weather") air-movement modifiers

command = { type = \[snow_move/blizzard_move/rain_move/storm_move\]

##  Introduction 

The structure of the tech files has changed quite a bit from HoI to HoI2
as the tech system has undergone big changes. However, the tech files
are still quite easy to mod.

  

##  Basic Structure 

The main structure of a tech file is a single tech application, like
"Early Infantry Division".

    application = { # Early Infantry Division
        id = 1020                                ID
        name = TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_NAME                      Name
        desc = TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_DESC

        position = { x = 24 y = 48 }                     Position
        year = 1936                              Year

        component = { # Service Rifle                        Components
                id = 1021
                name = TECH_CMP_INFANTRY_2_1_NAME
                type = general_equipment
                difficulty = 5
        }

        ##four more components

        required = { 1010 }                          Prerequisites
        effects = {                              Effects
            command = { type = new_model which = infantry value = 1 }
                command = { type = scrap_model which = infantry value = 0 }
                command = { type = activate_unit_type which = police }
        }
    }

  

###  ID 

Each tech has an ID which must be unique. It's convienent to use the IDs
the same way Paradox uses them. All IDs should have the following
structure:

The first digit should be a number between 1 and 9 to notify which tech
tree this tech belongs to. (1 = infantry, 2 = armor, 3 = naval, 4 =
aircraft, 5 = industry, 6 = land doctrines, 7 = secret weapons, 8 =
naval doctrines, 9 = air doctrines)

The next two digits should just be an integer counting the techs in the
file, e.g. "Early Infantry Division" is the second tech in the
*infantry_tech.txt* file and has 02 there.

The last digit should be a 0 for the application.

  

###  Name 

This specifies the tech name that appears ingame. This is language
specific and found in the *config/tech_names.csv* file.

Example:

       name = "TECH_APP_INFANTRY_2_NAME"

The name can also be inserted right into the file. However, there is
also a short name for each tech found in *config/tech_names.csv* and
that is the one that'll be displayed on the buttons. It has the same
string name as the complete description prefixed with a "SHORT\_"

Example:

       name = "Basic Infantry Division"

The description is not used and is a relic from HoI1.

  

###  Position 

Position of the button in the tech tree measured in pixels from the
upper left corner of the tech tree graphic.

Example:

       position = { x = 24 y = 48 }

[Position measured in
pixels](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Techfiles_upperleftcorner_small.png "File:Techfiles upperleftcorner small.png")

You can define more than one position for each tech as is seen in the
Naval Doctrines screen. You just have to add another position clause for
each position.

  

###  Historical Year 

The historical year factors heavily into research if you try to get a
tech ahead of its historical date. Your research speed will be divided
by *(1 + d Ã— m)* with *d* being the number of days you are away from
January 1st of the historical year and *m* being the multiplier in
*misc.txt* . Researching one year ahead of time will give you a penalty
of 54%. Note however that this is calculated component-wise, so the
later components suffer less penalty than the earlier ones.

  

###  Components 

Each tech has five components.

Example:

    component = { # Great War Tank Prototype Tests
        id = 2015                ID
        name = TECH_CMP_ARMOR_1_5_NAME       Name
        type = technical_efficiency      Type
        difficulty = 5               Difficulty
        double_time = yes            Double Time
    }

####  Component ID 

Each tech component has an ID. The first three digits should be the same
as with the application the tech belongs to and the last digit should
count the components from 1 to 5.

####  Component Name 

This specifies the component name that appears ingame. This is language
specific and found in the *config/tech_names.csv* file.

Example:

       name = TECH_CMP_ARMOR_1_5_NAME

The name can also be inserted right into the file.

Example:

       name = "Great War Tank Prototype Tests"

Note quotes are only needed if you are inserting the text directly.
Strings should be quote-free (or so my testing has shown).

####  Component Type 

Each component has one of 34 different types. If a research team has
this [component
type](/List_of_Component_Types "List of Component Types") as speciality,
they'll research that component 50% faster than a team without it.

####  Component Difficulty 

Each component has a difficulty. This is a positive integer. While the
game out of the box only uses difficulties between 3 and 10, it is
possible to assign difficulties outside this interval. Note however that
difficulties are not linear so that difficulty 8 doesn't take twice as
much time as difficulty 4.

####  Double Time 

Double time does exactly what you would expect from its name. It doubles
the research time for the respective component. This is mainly used for
the prototypes of vehicles, ships and aircraft in the game out of the
box. If you don't want to double the time, just don't use this line.

###  Prerequisites 

The required clause lists the techs needed to research the tech in
question. These can be an empty set or you can list as many techs as you
want. However, as the game does not show tech interlinks between the
different pages and the indicator for needed techs on the same page is
easily overseen, you should modify the background picture for the tech
tree you are working in to show the dependencies.

Example: (Tech 1010 is required to research the tech in question)

    required = { 1010 }

You can also use a second type of this clause which will allow you to
make a set of prerequisites of which only one is needed. Note that this
can combined with necessary prerequisites. The required clause must
always be in, even if it is empty.

Example: (Tech 8160 is required and **one** of 8180 and 8080 is also
required)

    OR_required = { 8180 8080 }
    required = { 8160 }

  

###  Effects 

Each tech can have one or more effects.

Copy & Paste from *event commands.txt* (will format it later)

####  Chance of Combat Events 

There are seven commands (breakthrough, ambush, assault, counterattack,
delay, encirclement, tactical_withdrawal) to affect the chance of combat
events occurring. The value is additive.

Example:

    type = counterattack value = 4

This will increase the probability for a counterattack by 4%.

####  HQ effects 

#####  HQ Supply Efficiency Modifier 

The HQ divisions give a bonus on Supply Efficiency for all units in
adjactant provinces. This bonus can be changed by techs.

Example:

    type = hq_supply_eff value = X

Increases the Supply Efficiency bonus of HQs by X percent points.

type = sce_frequency value = X \# Combat event chance multiplier.
Default: 1.0

1.  Enable a certain type of mission

type = enable_task which = \[task type\]

1.  New models updates the current template for a division or brigade
    type.

command = { type = \[new_model\] which = \[division or brigade type\]
value = \[The model number\] }

1.  Make a division or brigade type available for construction.

command = { type = activate_unit_type which = \[division or brigade
type\] }

1.  Make a division or brigade type unavailable for construction.

command = { type = deactivate_unit_type which = \[division or brigade
type\] }

1.  ACTIVATE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY OF MISSILES

command = { type = nuclear_carrier which = \[flying_bomb/flying_rocket\]
}

1.  ACTIVATE MISSILE CAPABILITY OF SUBMARINES

command = { type = missile_carrier which = \[submarine\] }

1.  UNIT VALUES
2.  \[unit value\] =
    soft_attack/hard_attack/ground_defense/air_attack/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/max_organization/transport_weight/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/speed_cap_art/speed_cap_eng/speed_cap_at/speed_cap_aa
3.  

NOTE: I think some of these are out of date, I was modding around today
and "ground_defense" seems to have changed to "defensiveness". Others
might have changes aswell.

1.  Land unit bonuses

command = { type = \[unit value\] which = \[land/division type/brigade
type\] value = \[additive value modifier\] }

1.  Air unit bonuses

command = { type =
\[air_attack/strategic_attack/tactical_attack/naval_attack/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/surface_detection/air
detection/transport_capacity/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/range\]
which = \[air/division type/brigade type\] value = \[additive value
modifier\] }

1.  Naval unit bonuses

command = { type =
\[naval_attack/air_attack/shore_attack/naval_defense/air_defense/build_cost/build_time/manpower/speed/surface_detection/air
detection/visibility/transport_capacity/supply_consumption/fuel_consumption/range\]
which = \[naval/division type/brigade type\] value = \[additive value
modifier\] }

1.  NOTE: For "build_time" and "build_cost", it is possible to add the
    field "where = relative".
2.  This means that the value is parsed as a relative modifier (%)
    instead of an absolute addition.
3.  When doing this, THE BASE VALUE OF MODEL 0 IS USED FOR \_ALL\_
    MODELS. So "value = -10" means
4.  "-10% of the value of model 0".
