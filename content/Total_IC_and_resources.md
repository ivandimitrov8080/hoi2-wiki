title: "Total_IC_and_resources"

Because the strategic aim of warfare in Hoi2 is to secure your own
country's place in the world by conquering provinces with high IC and
resources, it might be interesting to know how many of them are out
there to claim. The following data is collected from the db/province.csv
file and shows the raw numbers on the 1936 campaign start. Note that you
will not gain the full value if the respective province is not a core of
your country and also note that the raw values can be modified by a
variety of factors ranging from research to events.

Thanks to the Paradox forum user BritishImperial, for it was his
question which initiated this endeavour!

Note that manpower is computed differently in this mod, so while the raw
values are much higher than in the standard game, the effective values
are quite similar (even somewhat lower).
