#  Province Improvement 

###    Where is the best place to build a new factory? 

In provinces with high infrastructure factories will be completed faster
than in lower ones.

If you are playing DD this does not apply. A factory built in a 40%
infra province will be built in exactly same time as in a 100% infra
province.

###    Does increasing infrastructure also increase the resource output of the province? 

No.

Some players have claimed that in a handful of low-infrastructure (eg.
20), high resource-yield provinces, you can increase resource yield by
increasing infrastructure, but this has never been verified. Note that
the machine tool techs increase both IC and resource production, so when
players see resource increases, it would more likely be due to the
machine tool tech rather than to increasing infrastructure.

There is very little you can do to increase resource extraction except
to liberate puppets since puppets are limited to 1000 of each resource
and give their master the excess. A formula explaining the resource
extraction parameters is given in this thread: [Formula for resources
from non-national
provinces](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=209413)
. Resource extraction can go down due to strategic bombing and to battle
damage; pause over one of the resource icons to see the current and
maximum %.

###    What is the difference between size 1 and size 10 airbase/navalbase? 

All bases can hold as many divisions/ships as you care to put there. The
size of the base determines how fast those units regain organization and
strength. Units based in a facility above its size capacity will regain
organization and strength at a much lower rate.

###    What is the purpose of [radar](/Radar "Radar") station? 

The functions are:

-   Reduces enemy air units' combat efficiency by 2.5% for each level of
    radar you have in the territory.
-   The effectiveness of this factor can be increased by research. A 30%
    radar efficiency would mean 1.3\*2.5.
-   Coastal radar stations have a combat air battle factor in adjacent
    seazones. On land, however, each province's radar is used only for
    that province without any adjacency effects.

    units](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=218736)

    in HOI2 and HOI2 DD versions 1.0 and 1.1:
    -   Without it the airunits on air-superiority missions will just
        move towards random provinces within the area.
    -   With it, the airunit will know about any planes nearby that is
        heading to/through the province with the radar.
-   Radar [does not provide
    detection](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showpost.php?p=8204611&postcount=27)
    after HOI2DD 1.2 through ARMA 1.2. Two comments by Johan on pg 2 of
    a long thread: [Johan mentions but does not explain the
    change](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=346220&page=2)
-   In ARMA, Radar improves naval engagement range
-   Since radar is intelligence related, it's always us vs them
    comparisons for spotting purposes. Slider (open vs closed society),
    relative tech levels for encryption and decryption, and difficulty
    levels influence how well radar detects the enemy.

###    What do Rocket Test Facilities and Nuclear Reactors do? 

Both of these techs reduce the amount of time needed to research
Rocketry and Nuclear Research respectively. The more test
facilities/reactors you have, the less time it takes to complete
research in those fields. In addition, a nuclear reactor of sufficient
size is needed to build an atomic bomb.

More information on the effects (including a statistical breakdown)
these facilities can be found in the [Research](/Research "Research")
guide.
