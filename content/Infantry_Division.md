Infantry will most likely make up the bulk of your army. They are
relatively cheap to build and require no regular fuel supply to
manoeuvre, but their lack of motorized transport means their speed of
advance is limited. However, Infantry are able to occupy large areas of
land, securing ground captured by other forces.
