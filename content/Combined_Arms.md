**Combined Arms** is a [combat
modifier](/index.php?title=Combat_modifier&action=edit&redlink=1 "Combat modifier (page does not exist)")
that can be acheaved via mixed formations (refer [Land Combat Efficiency
FAQ](/Land_Combat_Efficiency_FAQ "Land Combat Efficiency FAQ") )

-   when units number \<= [Command Penalty
    Capacity](/Command_Penalty_Capacity "Command Penalty Capacity") (
    [CPC](/index.php?title=CPC&action=edit&redlink=1 "CPC (page does not exist)")
    )(not double),
-   To get the Combined Arms bonus, the mix of hard vs soft divisions
    has to be within a range of 1/3 to 2/3. Typically that would be 1:2
    or 2:1
-   The hard divisions are armor, light armor, and mech. Soft divisions
    are everything else including HQ. Brigades are not a factor in the
    ratio.
    -   attacker: Eff+5%
    -   defender: Eff+15%
    -   The CA bonus is set in the \db\misc.txt file and can be
        modified. The designation of which div are hard and which are
        soft, however, is set up in the executable file and is not
        modifiable.
    -   To qualify for the combined arms bonus, it is not sufficient for
        hard and soft divisions to just be in the same province. The
        divisions must be in the same formation under one leader. Mech
        and armor in the same formation do not get the combined arms
        bonus since both are hard targets. Motor and armor, or infantry
        and armor, would qualify for the bonus.
