-   according to official CPC stats, at the end of the war against
    japan, the communists had a regular army of 930 000 men and an
    organized militia of some 2 200 000 (1.253)

Above statistics lacked substantiation as a result of the defeat of the
Nationalist Regime in 1949. At the time Japan surrendered, the Chinese
communist party was entrenched in Rectification Movement 1942-1945 as
well as a party congress for power consolidation. Only American planes
from Dixie Mission saved the communist cause by flying out commanders.
The exact number, which was also recorded by Russians, did not exceed
300,000-400,000 troops for the communist New Fourth Army and Eight Route
Army combined. Even after the expansion of troops in Manchuria, the
total headcount did not exceed 500,000 by Nov 1945 when the Nationalist
Army began the deployment toward the northeastern territory.

Complete reorganization of the army (1.195)

Alpha Program

-   39 divisions would be trained and equipped
    -   train 500 000 Chinese troops
    -   300 000 will be armed soldiers
-   if completed, this plan would have affected approximately 1/6th of
    the entire Chinese regular army as reorganized
-   the plan was fully realized for only 12 as far as equipment was
    concerned

-   Militarily, Mao Tse-tung agreed to compress to 48 and consecutively
    43 divisions, so that communist forces would be amounting to 1/6th
    and consecutively 1/7th the size of 263 KMT divisions. Chiang
    Kai-shek stated that they intended to compress the army to 120
    divisions, but communists refused to lower to 20 divisions.

-   94th Corps
    -   5th Div commanded by Li Zefen

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
) In Manchuria, the forces were:

-   New 1st Corps commanded by Zheng Dongguo
-   New 6th Corps
-   52nd Corps
-   71st Corps commanded by Liang Huashen

Also the Yunnanese 60th and 92nd corps were coming to Manchuria

##  Nov-Dec 1945 

On 27 November 1945 General George Marshall began his efforts to mediate
a solution to the Chinese civil war. General Marshall arrived in China
in December 1945 with the hope of brokering a cease-fire between the KMT
and the CCP, and of building a coalition government that would include
all of the contending political/military groups in China.

#  1946 

-   Two major campaigns occurred in early 1946 in east and west
    Manchuria. To the east, government troops recovered the territories
    of Western Liaoning Province and Jehol \[excluding Chifeng and
    Chengde\]; and to the east, government troops routed Lin Biao's
    communist troops at the Battle of Shaling. A respite ensued till
    Russians suddenly pulled out of Manchuria beginning from March 1946
    when George Marshal took off for America, which was very much a
    calculated event. Government troops then hastily marched north to
    recover Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin, but encountered stiff
    communist resistance along the China Eastern Railway. Fightings
    centered around the railway nexus of Sipingjie for one and half a
    month.
-   "Dian-jun", the Yunnanese army, designated the 184th Division, of
    the 50th corps, defected to the Communists in Haiching, Liaoning
    Province on May 29th. The defection included only one regiment and
    the division command center. The majority of the defector troops, on
    a later occasion, fled a north-bound train and re-joined the
    Nationalist Army to be Re-organized 184th Division.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

    divisions equipped with American assistance during the latter part
    of the war, though not all of them were trained to cmobat readiness
    (1.246) other fine units were:
    -   crack Guangxi Armies
    -   northern troops under Generals Fu Zuoyi and Sun Lianzhong
    -   hard fighting Xibei San Ma Cavalry
    -   northwestern armies

&nbsp;

-   mid 1946, the Nationalists had 3 000 000 men (1.253)

    army numbered some 1 150 000 (1.253)
-   at the end of 1946, the Nationalists had 2 600 000 men (1.253)

#  1947 

-   On March 13, Hu Zongnan led a 140 000 strong army against Yan'an and
    took over the empty city as popular history textbooks claimed. The
    historical truth, however, shows that Hu Zongnan's actual fighting
    force consisted of two re-organized Corps or about six re-organized
    divisions, with a fighting force of about 18 re-organized brigades
    at varying size of 5000-7000 per brigade. On the cmmunist side, the
    army at Yenan consisted of about 120,000-150,000 regular troops and
    military district troops.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

-   Also in march, Communist forces under Chen Yi, after suffering a
    serious defeat at the hands of a Guangxi army column (consisting of
    the 7th and 48th corps),, seized the opportunity to destroy one of
    the best US equipped army corps (74th) of the central army at
    Mengliangkan , killing the commander, Zhang Ningfu (1.252)

&nbsp;

-   On May 14th, Su Yu forced Zhang Lingfu onto Mt Menglianggu, Shandong
    Province by encircling KMT Reinforced 74th Division (i.e.,
    originally Yu Jishi's 74th Corps) with 5 echelons and cutting off
    KMT relief armies with another 4 echelons. On May 16th, 100,000
    communist forces totally destroyed 32,000 KMT forces, with a
    casualty of 12,000 on the communist side

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

-   Also, Communists in Manchuria launch an offensive
    -   KMT's 88th Division of 71st Corps was destroyed while en route
        to the relief of Huaide.
-   In mid-June, communist forces, numbering 200,000, surrounded
    Sipingjie in a surprise move. KMT dispatched 53rd Corps to Shenyang
    from northern China. In the ensuing months, KMT lost 40 counties and
    80,000 soldiers in the fightings with communists.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

-   in the 50 day summer offensive in may 1947, communists made
    extensive use of artillery power against best-equipped gov't units
    and claimed 89 000 government losses

&nbsp;

-   in August, Chen Cheng replaces Xiong Shihui as director for
    Northeast Military District
    -   Chen Cheng relocates 49th corps to Manchuria from Northern
        Jiangsu
    -   shortly after, 105 division of 49th corps destroyed
-   Chen Cheng re-organized Du Yuming's local security forces into New
    3rd Corps, New 5th Corps, New 7th Corps and New 8th Corps.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

-   By mid-Oct, communists, totalling 500,000 in Manchuria area, mounted
    an "autumn campaign" and destroyed about 100,000 KMT forces,
    including Chen Xinda's New 5th Corps in Gongzhuling.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
)

-   late 1947, the Nationalists had 2 700 000 men (1.253)

#  1948 

-   throughout 1948, the Nationalists had about 2 730 000 men (1.253)

&nbsp;

    -   north China Command led by Fu Zuoyi
    -   central China command led by Bai Chongxi
    -   northwest China command led by Ma Bufang
    -   although they were honored with major commands, none was
        entrusted with important authority in the central military
        establishment

&nbsp;

-   under Bai Chongxi, the central China command did pretty well against
    the communists(1.248)

&nbsp;

Swans"), CCP forces sacked Yixian county, to the north of Jinzhou, and
destroyed KMT 93rd Corps plus one cavalry column, totalling 10,000 men.
Fan Hanjie's forces in Jinzhou city were hence surrounded by CCP forces
on all sides. \[...\] Meantime, Chiang Kai-shek air-lifted 49th Corps to
Jinzhou for assistance with city defence. Jinzhou was said to have been
cut off from outside world by Sept 26th.

###  October 

"despite the basic soundness of his order for simultaneous attacks from
Mukden and Changchun in order to effectuate the breakout of government
force from Changchun, his commands were not obeyed in full. General Wei
Lihuang's force did not lash out from Mukden in full strength. In
despair, one of the garrison units, the 60th Army (Yunnanese) revolted
and turned its guns on the loyal New 7th Army. The latter, a parly
American trained force, was the backbone of the city's defense forces.
On the 20th of the month, Changchun and its starving defenders fell into
communist hands." (1.259)

-   Jinzhou, a supply base for Manchuria between Mukden and Beiping was
    surrounded (1.259)
    -   held some 70 000 nationalist troops, including crack units of
        the recently arrived 8th Army under General Fan Hanjie,
        reputedly one of Whampoa's ables commanders
    -   wei lihuang was in Mukden, and was ordered to bring his 150 000
        man force (composed of 12 divisions and 3 cavalry brigades) to
        the relief of the Jinzhou siege, but delayed and then moved out
        hesitantly with only a fraction of his strength
    -   meanwhile, strong gov't reinforcements (9 divisions) were landed
        at the port of Hulutao, but only a portion of them moved to the
        aid of besieged Jinzhou
-   certain gov't units within the city deserted to the communists and
    the city fell

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
) After receivng the breakout order, Zheng Dongguo ordered that New 38th
Division push to the position. On the night of Oct 17th, Zeng Zesheng's
60th Corps declared an uprising for the communist camp, and cut
Changchun city into two parts.

order that Liao Yaoxiang's Army Group, with an addition of 207th
Division of 6th Corps, attack Heishan and that Liu Yuezhang's 52nd Corps
attack Yingkou for securing the withdrawal route of Liao Yaoxiang.
Secretly, Wei Lihuang instructed Shenyang garrison division chief Wang
Lihuan in guaranteeing the peaceful transfer of Shenyang and its 2
million citizens to CCP.

( [uglychinese.org](http://www.uglychinese.org/civil_wars.htm#civilwar)
) Liao Yaoxiang's army group, the heroes of Burma, were destroyed by the
Communists by October 28th

) Du Yuming was dispatched to Shenyang for assisting Wei Lihuang & Zhou
Fucheng in city defence. Shenyang still possessed 53rd Corps, 6th Corps
and 207th Division.

-   loss of manchuria and some 300 000 of its best troops spelled the
    beginning of the end for the natioanlists. Nearly 360 000 communist
    troops from manchuria were now free to move against china proper.
    (p.260)
    -   550 000 men of the communist 3rd and 2nd field armies,

        desparate effort both to rescue Huang Wei's army group and
        retreat to a more defensible position
    -   Huang's army, ordered by Generalissimo Chiang to converge upon
        Xuzhou, and consisting of 5 army corps, 1 divisions and a
        mechanized column, was taken away from bai Chongxi's central
        China command
    -   it ran into a communist encirclement SW of \<Suhsien\>

"Fu Zuoyi, commander of North China, concentrated his main force int he
Beiping-Tianjin area for a decisive battle, counting upon a communist
regrouping period of at least one and a half months before Red general
Lin Biao could move his army into the Great Wall. To his surprise, Lin
Biao's force appeared in his area barely twenty days after the fall of
Mukden and, unfortunately, Fu's war plans and his troop dispositions
became known to the communists through internal treachery." (1.264)

    communists occupied Nanjing on april 24. Tang Enbo spoke of making
    Shanghai a "ssecond Stalingrad" but lost Shanghai a month later
