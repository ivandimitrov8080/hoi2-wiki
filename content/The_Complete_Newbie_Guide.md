##  Game Versions 

Hearts of Iron 2 has had many [versions](/Versioning "Versioning") . The
original game is referred to as HoI2, or "vanilla" and was released in
2005. This game had a series of patches that ended with version 1.3. An
expansion pack called Doomsday or "DD" was released in 2006, and also
had a series of patches that ended in version 1.3. Doomsday is a
standalone and thus does not require the original HoI2 to be installed.
Finally, [Armageddon](/Armageddon "Armageddon") or "ARMA", is a booster
pack for Doomsday that was released in 2007, and has had a series of
patches that have ended in version 1.2. Since early 2009, there is a
1.3(beta) patch for Armageddon which fixes all known bugs and introduces
a new espionage system. It is being developed by the community but with
the blessing of Paradox.

Armageddon is the latest game version and includes all features of the
previous two. In the Anthology pack, Armageddon is a standalone (and
thus does not require any other game version to be installed) while as a
separate game it is an add-on for Doomsday and thus requires Doomsday to
be installed.

##  Choose Game Type 

In order to start on the right foot select a game type that makes the
most sense for your learning style.

-   Tutorials: These are a good starting point for the real basics.
    Remember that those tutorials have not been adjusted to the
    expansions and thus may result in errors when playing Doomsday or
    Armageddon.
-   Battle Scenarios: These are good for limiting complexity, and
    learning the basics. The [Spanish Civil
    War](/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") scenario which is a
    fun, eventful little package that will introduce you to all the
    fundamentals.
-   1936 campaign:
    -   For a peaceful, simple game of just the basics,
        [Brazil](/Brazil_strategy "Brazil strategy") is a good choice.
    -   For a start at war, [USSR](/USSR_strategy "USSR strategy") is an
        excellent choice because it is possible to defeat Germany
        without much skill.
    -   As a general rule, trying to reverse history (German or Japanese
        victory) is more challenging gameplay than a victory with the
        Allies.

##  Walk through 

Some step by step guides have been created to help new players:

##  General Overview 

###  Intelligence 

Available in HoI2, Doomsday:

-   Using the Intelligence system is not essential for gameplay.
    Beginners should ignore it for simplicity: some advanced players
    ignore it due to its relatively low impact/benefit.
-   Before performing any mission, it is a good idea to set up 10 spies
    in the target country (which also includes your own), as spy mission
    success chance depends largely on the number of spies and failed
    missions make you lose one spy. In Armageddon 1.3beta the espionage
    system has been changed drastically: there failed missions don't
    have any negative effect apart from the money lost, so you can
    happily spy away.
-   It helps to remove all AI spies in your nation, as they can disrupt
    production, etc. (Not possible in Armageddon 1.3beta.)
-   The most widely used feature of the spying system is to steal
    blueprints.

###  Technology 

-   Always use as many [research slots](/Research_Slot "Research Slot")
    as possible.
-   Avoid researching technologies whose historical year is in the
    future due to penalties to research time.
-   Match the specialties of the selected tech team with whatever you
    intend to research.
-   See the [Research](/Research "Research") guide for more information
    on how to maximize research.

###  Production 

-   Serial runs provide bonuses to time to complete due to the
    [Gearing_Bonus](/Gearing_Bonus "Gearing Bonus") . Thus, a serial run
    of 10 infantry is much quicker to produce, and is much easier to
    manage as a player. Since cancelling an ongoing serial yields no
    negative consequences, it is even feasible to order each build as a
    99 serial and simply abort it once you've produced enough. That way
    you'll get your builds done the quickest.

###  Diplomacy 

-   Take a look at the [Domestic Policy
    FAQ](/Domestic_Policy_FAQ "Domestic Policy FAQ") for advice on
    changing your domestic policy sliders. There are definite directions
    you want to move your nation to accomplish certain goals.
-   Examine your resource situation carefully, and if you are tight in
    anything, scour the world for trades to build up stockpiles in it.
    Italy and [Japan](/Japan "Japan") have a particular need for this
    monitoring. Once war starts your national trade with nations who are
    non-neighbours will drop sharply in efficiency, so build up
    stockpiles while the world is at peace.

##  Military Basics 

-   Your leaders have a rank which determines how many divisions they
    can command. To increase the rank, simply press the "promote" button
    in the leader selection window. This will cost the leader in
    question one skill point and it will reset his experience to zero.
    Keep in mind not to over-stack leaders: which means a Major General
    should only have 1 division, a Lt. General should only have 3
    divisions or less, a General should have no more than 9 divisions
    and a Field Marshal should be content with commanding no more than
    12 divisions.
-   Enabling the Auto-promotions option for your leaders will give you
    "free" promotions, without those leaders losing skill level.
-   Always be mindful of the terrain and weather you are fighting in
    (hills, plains, swamp forest, mountains, rivers -- mud, winter,
    rain, etc): it makes a huge difference.
-   Units like Marines and Mountaineers exist for a reason: they are
    masters of certain terrain types and/or mission types such as
    amphibious assaults.
-   Garrisons with MP brigades are useful in order to reduce partisan
    activities (which lowers your Transport Capacity, or "TC"). Units
    that are in good supply fight better.
-   Always remember to check your time of day and weather before an
    attack. Badly timed attacks can wear down even the best prepared
    attacker.
-   Time your offensives on a strategic (long-term) time-scale. For
    example, attacking the Soviet Union as Germany in winter will wear
    you down for little gain, and almost eliminate the chance for the
    all-important encirclements. Winter warfare is no fun, just ask the
    German general staff.
-   Encirclement is the only practical way of 'killing' enemy units.
    Plan strategic traps such as cutting units off against the coast and
    try deep striking tank attacks to get the enemy units behind your
    lines.
-   If your attack (or defense) is going badly, or even if it's stalled
    call it off (or retreat) and think of a new approach. Your units
    will keep their valuable organisation and strength, and will be
    ready for the next attack (or counter-attack).
-   Use HQ units for any large attacks to prevent over-stacking
    penalties, and use support attack from other provinces to bring an
    overwhelming force against the enemy.
-   Remember to give your HQ units general or field-marshal leaders, or
    else the HQ units are effectively useless.
-   Don't be afraid of trading land for time or strategic advantage. On
    defensive fronts consider letting the enemy take a front-line
    province if your line is attacked by a superior force, and then
    counter-attack from the flanking provinces using the unit(s) you
    cunningly withdrew. Then the enemy gets a 20% penalty and things
    will probably go badly for him.
-   Check the detailed combat status of your (and enemy) units by
    reading the tool-tip on the unit in the detailed battle view. This
    is a neat summary of the factors affecting the combat and a great
    way of learning when and why you have the advantage or disadvantage
    in battle.

##  Things to ignore 

-   Don't worry about convoys. Convoys are important for amphibious
    landings and maintaining overseas supply, but are safe to ignore for
    a new player.
-   Don't worry about leader assignment. Switch on auto-assign and the
    AI will find suitable leaders to leaderless stacks at midnight every
    day.
-   Air Force and Navy are best ignored for beginning players.
