title: "CORE"

CORE is the Community Open Resource Exchange. CORE aims to make Hearts
of Iron 2 a more historically accurate and involving game, through
expanded and more detailed tech trees, corresponding units, tech teams
and a large number of events, reflecting both historical actions and
possibilities. Both Industrial Capacity („IC‟) and resources for the
entire game have been revised to better reflect reality in the late
1930s.

Other features include reserve divisions instead of militia (a reserve
unit is less mobile, and has less heavy weapons - such as artillery.
These units form the mainstay of the armies of the minor and
semi-industrialized countries), rares scarcity, SS recruitment, 1:1
naval ship representation and negative resource production (representing
civilian spoilage of energy and oil). The basic CORE installer includes
generic graphics for techs, tech teams, leaders, ministers and generic
models that have been updated to fit the latest release. There are also
optional packages to download with an even greater amount of graphics
available, such as country-specific model graphics and tech imagery.
