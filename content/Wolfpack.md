###  Submarine Wolfpack 

Any group of [submarines](/Submarine "Submarine") that includes no
surface ships forms a **wolfpack** . Large groups are good for naval
combat in HoI2 and ARMA, but considered ahistorical and gamey.

####  Convoy Raiding 

When using submarines to create pickets, Subs should be positioned on
the high seas, as far as possible from enemy Air and Naval bases, in
order to force the enemy to come out and fight the player's subs under
conditions that give the enemy no advantage (no Air support, no Air
spotting, no quick reaction from supporting forces in a nearby Port).

The other requirement for Sub-fleet positioning is that together they
must form a complete blockade-cordon, cutting the enemy capital from all
possible convoy destinations. The AI will automatically shift the route
of a Convoy that has suffered U-Boat or Air attack... but this won't
help it at all as long as *all possible* Convoy-routes are covered by
subs.

####  Doomsday and Armageddon 

In Doomsday, submarines were significantly reduced in power, so much so
that many players called them worthless. In an infamous thread on the
Paradox forums (Blue Emu's [Are Submarines
Worthless](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=264824)
), it is shown that a German wolfpack strategy can be highly devastating
to English supply convoys, effectively destroying their ability to fight
overseas. With a 63 Uboat fleet (1938 model), Blue Emu tallied the
following losses for the UK in 1939:

September : 227 Convoys, 27 Escorts  
October : 149 Convoys, 33 Escorts  
November : 117 Convoys, 13 Escorts  
December : 161 Convoys, 26 Escorts  

This accounted for nearly half of the British convoy fleet in the first
four months of war. While England's home supply stockpile was not
affected due to pre-war build up, their armies overseas (North Africa,
India, and South East Asia) were rendered out of supply. This means
relatively easy victories for Italy and Japan. Further, trade
efficiencies drastically suffered:

Trade with Norway, Sweden and Latvia is 100%.  
Trade with the USA, Mexico, Chile and Panama is 57.9%.  
Trade with Saudi Arabia is 51.8%.  
Trade with Yugoslavia is 51.1%.  
Trade with China is 26.0%  

Beginning with Armageddon 1.2, players have reported large success in
using large sub stacks against surface ships, especially in the early
war years.
