*Gamey tactics* are shorthand for "game the system", or put in another
way, "cheat the system" by means of design flaws or poor AI. Gamey
tactics almost always lead to ahistorical and extremely unrealistic
results. Classic gamey tactics in HoI2 include:

-   **Withdrawal & Flank:** German withdrawal of troops from the French
    border, causing the French AI to take German territory, and then
    outflanking the bulk of the French army by capturing an abandoned
    maginot line.
-   **Spamming infantry or IC:** Spamming IC for years on end is
    extremely unrealistic, while creating a 100% infantry only army is
    highly imbalanced (though of course extremely effective in game).
-   **Puppets:** Large puppets, such as a Japanese puppet of Nationalist
    China, are highly unrealistic due to their huge amount of power.
-   **The "Soldier of Fortune" approach:** You can play the game as one
    country, then save the game, and return to the game as another
    country. You can pretty much always be where the action is.
