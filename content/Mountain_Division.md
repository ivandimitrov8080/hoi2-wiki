Mountain Troops are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically
trained for operations in mountainous terrain. They make use of
specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular
Infantry in such an environment.

##  Mountain Division Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades allowed 

-   [Anti-aircraft
    Brigade](/Anti-aircraft_Brigade "Anti-aircraft Brigade")
-   [Anti-Tank Brigade](/Anti-Tank_Brigade "Anti-Tank Brigade")
-   [Artillery Brigade](/Artillery_Brigade "Artillery Brigade")
-   [Engineer Brigade](/Engineer_Brigade "Engineer Brigade")
-   [Police Brigade](/Police_Brigade "Police Brigade")

##  Notes 

-   Mountain divisions are considered soft units
-   Mountaineers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard
    attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a
    normal infantry of the same year.
-   They get far less combat penalties when fighting in winter, frozen,
    snow or even blizzard conditions.
-   They get attack and defence bonuses in mountains and hills, which
    increase further along the tech tree.
-   In fact, the defence bonuses can get so staggeringly high that it
    becomes impossible to get a few mountaineer divisions out of a
    mountainous province during winter using conventional warfare.
