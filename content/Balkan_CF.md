A Balkan CF is when a series of war declarations by minor powers in the
Balkan areas causes the war to go non-historical. These war declarations
are caused a web of independence guarantees in that area.

How to avoid this:

-   The guarantees will expire at new year 1940, so stay out of the area
    until then.
-   The Italy AI will become aggressive in Balkans when Paris falls, so
    German players should wait with invading France until 1940.
