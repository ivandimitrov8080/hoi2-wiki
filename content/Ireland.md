##  Overview 

Ireland has got to be one of the least played nations in HoI2. The
reason being;it is almost completely isolationist and 'borders' one of
the most powerful nations on the globe, at the time. Playing Ireland may
seem pointless, but do not be tricked; Ireland has an impressive group
of tech teams and leaders. Some advantages of the republic include the
following:

-   A wide range of tech teams, including a team with nuclear physics.
-   Strong Generals
-   Good leaders
-   A small surplus of resources

##  Technology 

Ireland has excellent industrial, aircraft, naval, air doctrine, and
naval doctrines tech teams. Basically, it lacks in ground combat and
ground doctrine tech teams. Focus on researching current year
technologies because of the penalty involved with researching ahead of
the 'historical' year. Research in manufacturing, infantry, and Grand
Battle Plan should be given top priority.

##  Diplomacy 

Ireland, due to it being completely neutral, has little to no potential
for alliances. However, events such as 'foreign policy initiative' may
allow Ireland to become more interventionist.

###  Foreign Policy Initiative 

There are two *feasible* choices for Ireland in this event. The first
one is to force it through, which would result in 2 shifts of
interventionism and 1 shift towards Political right, with the cost being
10 dissent. The other option, strike a bargain with the Liberals, would
result in 1 shift of interventionism, 1 shift towards free market, and 1
shift towards open society at the cost of 5 dissent. The choice is up to
you.

###  Demand Territory 

In keeping with the limited aims that are possible to achieve with minor
powers, one potential aim is to reclaim Northern Ireland. A successful
strategy in relation to this goal is first to form as many trades as
possible with the U.K. to increase your relationship. Secondly after
1942 begin funding partisans in Northern Ireland. Thirdly, when the
partisans rise up, ask to join the Allies so that you can occupy
Northern Ireland. By 1946 you should see the Demand Territory
probability rise up from 0% to around 2%. However by 1948 you'll have a
20% chance! Just keep Demanding territory and influencing the U.K. and
you should have Northern Ireland by 1949.

##  Overview 

Ireland has got to be one of the least played nations in HoI2. The
reason being;it is almost completely isolationist and 'borders' one of
the most powerful nations on the globe, at the time. Playing Ireland may
seem pointless, but do not be tricked; Ireland has an impressive group
of tech teams and leaders. Some advantages of the republic include the
following:

-   A wide range of tech teams, including a team with nuclear physics.
-   Strong Generals
-   Good leaders
-   A small surplus of resources

##  Technology 

Ireland has excellent industrial, aircraft, naval, air doctrine, and
naval doctrines tech teams. Basically, it lacks in ground combat and
ground doctrine tech teams. Focus on researching current year
technologies because of the penalty involved with researching ahead of
the 'historical' year. Research in manufacturing, infantry, and Grand
Battle Plan should be given top priority.

##  Diplomacy 

Ireland, due to it being completely neutral, has little to no potential
for alliances. However, events such as 'foreign policy initiative' may
allow Ireland to become more interventionist.

###  Foreign Policy Initiative 

There are two *feasible* choices for Ireland in this event. The first
one is to force it through, which would result in 2 shifts of
interventionism and 1 shift towards Political right, with the cost being
10 dissent. The other option, strike a bargain with the Liberals, would
result in 1 shift of interventionism, 1 shift towards free market, and 1
shift towards open society at the cost of 5 dissent. The choice is up to
you.

###  Demand Territory 

In keeping with the limited aims that are possible to achieve with minor
powers, one potential aim is to reclaim Northern Ireland. A successful
strategy in relation to this goal is first to form as many trades as
possible with the U.K. to increase your relationship. Secondly after
1942 begin funding partisans in Northern Ireland. Thirdly, when the
partisans rise up, ask to join the Allies so that you can occupy
Northern Ireland. By 1946 you should see the Demand Territory
probability rise up from 0% to around 2%. However by 1948 you'll have a
20% chance! Just keep Demanding territory and influencing the U.K. and
you should have Northern Ireland by 1949.
