Close Air Support (CAS) is the key to the blitzkrieg tactic. These
planes have the ability to strike precisely at enemy units, enabling
your ground forces to achieve a rapid breakthrough. They are slow,
sturdy planes and this makes them an easy target for enemy fighters.

##  Close-Air Support Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades Allowed 

-   None

##  Notes 

-   CAS are very vulnerable to an air attack. However, putting a
    [fighter](/Fighter "Fighter") or
    [interceptor](/Interceptor "Interceptor") division in your CAS stack
    will not help. In this case, the fighter will only prolong the air
    fight, resulting in higher losses than a pure CAS stack would
    suffer.
