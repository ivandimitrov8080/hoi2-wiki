title: "A.e.i.o.u."
---

The end of the Great War brought with it the end of the age of
monarchies. In Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Serbia,
ruling houses were overthrown and new governments installed in their
place. But those new governments were not always stable and were
themselves subject to opposition, and in some cases rebellion.

How might history have been different if, in the defeated Central
Powers, the emperors had returned? Play A.E.I.O.U., a modification of
Hearts of Iron 2, and find out. Can you lead Austria to reclaim her lost
glory?.
