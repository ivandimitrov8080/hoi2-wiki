##  Summary 

Greece, in most of the world, would be quite a military power (of the
order of Argentina or Brazil). Although its IC is small, its army can be
quite significant. Unfortunately, it's in Europe...

Diplomacy-wise, you're Paternal Autocrat, so you can join either Axis or
Allies. You also have cores in both (Cyprus, Rhodes and Dodecanese).

You start with 15 INF-18, 1 CAV-18, 2 ancient CLs, 2 equally ancient
DDs, 2 subs that probably saw service with Alexander, and 2 transport
fleets.

Greece is poor, which rules out building an air force or tanks. It's
also mountainous, which means even less tanks. And it's in the
Mediterranean, so that antediluvian fleet will get sunk by Italy (if you
go Allied) or the UK (if you go Axis). However, you can make it quite an
infantry power. And if you manage to build a small but modern navy (some
decent destroyers and a couple heavy cruisers for example) you'll be
able to fight the war actively around the Med, and even further if all
goes well...

##  Detailed analysis 

**Advantages**

-   Greece starts with a quite respectable (though outdated) army.
-   A few good tech teams, especially in the industrial and naval
    construction fields. Decent in land doctrines if you choose the
    "Grand Battle Plan Doctrine" path.
-   Greece can choose any path between Allies, Axis or non-aligned.
    Comintern would probably requier an important slider shift though
    (not play-tested).
-   The many hill provinces in Greek homeland give a notable advantage
    to the defensor.
-   Two border provinces start with level 5 land forts : Ioaninna and
    Salonika.
-   A few good leaders with the "offensive" or "defensive" traits. Even
    the 2 "old guard" generals can progress fairly quickly since their
    "optimal rank" is field marshal.
-   Good ministers available after a few years.

**Disadvantages**

-   Greece is located in Europe, at the crossroads of the 3 major
    alliances. The future is dark if the game plays historically...
-   Limited IC (starts with 15).
-   Thus, only one research slot in 1936.
-   Several traits lacking in your tech teams : under average concerning
    infantry, artillery and aircrafts, almost inexistant concerning
    naval doctrines and air doctrines.
-   The fleet you start with floats only because it's trendy. That may
    not last.
-   A serious flaw in your defenses : Larisa is not fortified.
-   Many beaches to defend.

##  General advices 

All general advices concerning minor powers apply to Greece, but since
one major alliance will be after you sooner or later, it's especially
vital to manage efficiently every resource you have.

-   Never research ahead of time, excepted if you have blueprints
    beforehand (and only in vital fields, like infantry).
-   Don't try to upgrade your army to the latest model available (unless
    it's a matter of life or death) : your IC is limited and it's way
    cheaper to upgrade them when they are "twice obsolete" (e.g. upgrade
    all your army to the 1936 standard when you have researched the 1939
    standard). Consequence : always research new infantry models as soon
    as reasonably possible.
-   Don't build more infantry than you can use : if the war is overseas,
    don't cripple your IC by building tens of divisions if your navy can
    not ship them safely.
-   Watch carefully your manpower pool. As far as defense goes, good
    land forts save you lots of manpower.
-   Be especially careful when engaging a country that enjoys a powerful
    air force, since you probably won't have one. Never let one or two
    divisions alone in the wild, or enemy CAS will bomb them into
    oblivion instantly.
-   Use the gearing bonus! While virtue is its own reward, the gearing
    bonus is the reward of a good planning. Plan things ahead, then run
    the number of item you want to produce in one row with full IC
    allowed to the construction. It's a lifesaver for minor countries!
    For example, after the 7th item produced, you'll enjoy a 35%
    discount on the build time for the rest of the series. Especially
    useful for: garrison divisions, land forts (if you want to reach
    level 10), destroyers, artillery brigades, infantry etc.

And naturally, check your available ministers every year : a few good
ones kick in at mid-game...

##  Tips and strategies to take a good start 

###    Don't be a bully 

All countries surrounding you have their independance guaranteed by at
least one major alliance (excepted Albania). Put the good old "Warmonger
Rampage From The Start Doctrine" (tm) in the closet, you won't need it
this time !

  

###  Make friends 

If you do nothing about world politics from the start of the game, Italy
will go to war against you, then Germany. Knowing that, it's better to
make a few friends beforehand.

Since you start "paternal autocrat", you can either join the Allies or
the Axis. Both will accept you into their alliance even if they are at
peace, if your relation with them reaches a decent level, like +140.

To achieve that, trade supplies for money from the start of the game.
While you're at it, boost your relation with your future ally to +200,
since once you are allied, you will want to buy blueprints and raw
materials : a maxed out relation with you new friends will grant you
huge discounts on the long run.

You can trade supplies for raw materials until the war starts. If you
plan to leave your alliance and wage the war alone, it's vital to have a
large stockpile. If you plan to stay with your allies, don't exhaust
yourself by buying raw materials : your allies will probably help you
for free if you're using more than you're producing. Use the IC for more
important matters.

  

###  Industrialize 

The decent army and land forts you start with will buy you security at
home until 1939 or 1940. Use the peacetime years to build 5 factories :
by the start of 1939 you'll have 20 IC, and a second tech team will be
available. Things are looking better already!

  

###  Win the Spanish Civil War 

There will be a war close to your home, and you don't want to miss it.
It's an excellent occasion to train your troops and leaders while taking
no risk for yourself. More over, the spanish navy is not excessively
powerful, and you should be able to ferry troops without loosing to much
naval battles.

You can choose any side in the war, depending on which alliance you plan
to join later on. Note that if you guarantee the independence of
Republican Spain, you can declare war against Nat. Spain as soon as the
Spanish civil war begins, with no dissent hit. Also note that you can
guarantee the Nationalists as soon as they appear and DOW the Rep. with
no dissent hit.

Acquier as much experience as you can while loosing as few men as
possible : defend rough terrains, or attack week enemy positions... At
the end of the war you should have several level 2 or 3 field marshals,
and your divisions will have 1, 2 or even 3 "stars of experience".

If the war does not go well, join your alliance. The French won't leave
a chance to Nat. Spain if you go Allies (resp. the Germans will land and
annex Rep. Spain if you go Axis). Then your new Spanish friends will
join your alliance. Rejoice.

Nota: another possibility is that the friendly spanish side gets
annexed: your goal then becomes to grab as much land from Spain as
possible before your major ally invades and annexes.

###  Fortress Greece 

Once you have discovered Advanced Construction Engineering (not before!)
start filling in the gap in Larisa : a level 10 land fort there will
probably be your life insurance sooner or later. If possible, expand the
level 5 forts in Ioaninna and Salonika to level 9 (max available in
those provinces). Once this is done, 3 to 6 Garrison divisions in each
province will be enough to deter almost any enemy. Remember to garrison
the beaches also : 2 or 3 Garrison divisions (depending if the terrain
is hills or plains) should be enough. If you have spare IC, 1 or 2
levels of coastal forts will make the "Fortres Greece" inviolable. Now
your homeland is safe, and you still have spare manpower : you can
divert your army to offensive tasks!

  

###    Don't forget the Navy! 

The Navy is an essential element of the Greek strategy.

-   If you're Allied or independent, the Wehrmacht will descend into the
    Balkans in 1941, and, hopefully, stop at the gates of your home-made
    Greek Maginot Line... But there is no way that you can succesfully
    counter-attack against the bulk of the Axis forces in the Balkans -
    you'll have to accept the stalemate in Greece (for now at least) and
    fight in Africa or in the "soft underbelly of Europe", Italy (and
    later, eventually, in occupied France)
-   If you're Axis, you'll want to fight in Egypt and in the
    Middle-East, or even land in the USSR (excepted if you're content to
    be Germany's pawn during Barbarossa and only send footsoldiers).

Let's face it: the war will be waged overseas, so, better be prepared.
You may have no hope to defeat the Kriegsmarine/Royal Navy head on:
basically, what you want is a navy strong enough to:

-   win a minor encounter while suffering minimal losses (e.g. a couple
    of destroyers or subs marauding)
-   protect your transport during the first few hours of a major
    encounter so that you can escape relatively safely.

Fortunately, you have a good tech team that will research new ship
models quickly - even quicker if you could trade for blueprints. My
advice : build 4 to 6 DD-IV (as soon as available) then 2 to 4 CA-IV.
Don't forget transports and supply convoys!

###  Win the Battle of France 

**Allies**

If you're Allied, it's the real crossroads of the game - if France
falls, Germany will send its army into the Balkans, and Greece will feel
very lonely very soon. That does not mean game over though: if you had
time to build your "Maginot Line" with land forts level 9 or 10 in
Ioaninna, Larisa and Salonika (and to garrison them properly), you can
stalemate the German offensive indefinitely. You will then have to help
the Allies on other battlefields until Germany bends under a might
greater than hers - this will be a long road but maybe someday you'll
have the pleasure to count among Europe's liberators!

But: if you want to take the short way towards victory, you must win the
battle of France.

If you already won the Spanish Civil War with Rep. Spain, now they
should be Allied, and have sent many divisions to the Franco-Belgian
border. The Spanish forces are a nice addition to the French ones, and
if you place strategically the 6 to 10 Greek divisions that you can send
abroad it becomes possible to win the Battle of France. Or, at least, to
stalemate it so that it turns into a war of attrition, effectively
neutralizing the German threat (playtested, without any gamey exploit -
it works ;) )

If you survive this long, use or create a small navy and move toward
Italy. If the have the Libyan coast covered, land in British navel bases
close to the middle east and try to grab some southern Libyan provinces.
If the italians are beat out in libya or if its looking like it than
head south toward Ethopia. once there, grab as much of it as you can.
Don't rush it if the Italians won out in africa. ( I have only seen the
Italians win out once, so you have great odds.

My advice: place your divisions in Brussels, Namur or Reims, and make
them "support attack" against the most likely enemy target. They will
take part to battles involving 40+ divisions and earn huge amounts of
experience, while saving the Free World altogether. What's not to
love? ;)

**Axis**

If you're Axis, the Germans handle the Battle of France rather well on
their own: your aim will be to grab as much land as possible in North
Africa / Syria / Southern France before the armistice.

If Nat. Spain is your ally, it may be a good idea to help them take
Gibraltar beforehand: that should increase the life expectancy of your
navy significantly and therefore increase your gains...

###  Aftermath 

Once this is done, you have almost unlimited possibilities about what to
do next...

As Allies, you can push into Germany along with the French, and attempt
landings of your own if you want to claim your share of land -
eventually you may be able to liberate Denmark or Norway as a Greek
puppet, for example. Then, remember that there is a war to win in Asia
against Japan!

As Axis, you can prepare Barbarossa, or alternatively try to conquer
Africa, the Middle-East and even India from the British.

Whatever path you choose, remember to build enough supply convoys and
escorts if you want to be able to hold Greek beachheads anywhere in the
world!

###  A word about land doctrines 

You start with the Firepower focus, and your only tech team dedicated to
land doctrines is only really efficient if you follow the Grand Battle
Plan path.

This path is weak during the early game, but can become really powerful
during the late game (after 1944)especially if your choose the
Infiltration Assault path, which yields a very high morale score for
your divisions (i.e. fast org. regain, really useful for offensives).

A country with a rather small army like Greece would perhaps be better
off with the Mobility/Blitzkrieg path which yields higher org values,
but the fact that it's harder to research and that your tech team is
weaker for this path should make you think twice before you choose this
path.

  

###  A word about sliders 

A clever move is to make 2 or 3 steps towards Central Planning: you'll
receive +15% or +20% IC. Then I suggest all the way towards Hawk Lobby
to have the production discounts. Finally, move the slider towards
Standing Army: since you'll likely follow the Grand Battle Plan path,
every little boost to the org. of your divisions is welcome.

-   Two border provinces start with level 5 land forts : Ioaninna and
    Salonika.
-   A few good leaders with the "offensive" or "defensive" traits. Even
    the 2 "old guard" generals can progress fairly quickly since their
    "optimal rank" is field marshal.
-   Good ministers available after a few years.

**Disadvantages**

-   Greece is located in Europe, at the crossroads of the 3 major
    alliances. The future is dark if the game plays historically...
-   Limited IC (starts with 15).
-   Thus, only one research slot in 1936.
-   Several traits lacking in your tech teams : under average concerning
    infantry, artillery and aircrafts, almost inexistant concerning
    naval doctrines and air doctrines.
-   The fleet you start with floats only because it's trendy. That may
    not last.
-   A serious flaw in your defenses : Larisa is not fortified.
-   Many beaches to defend.

##  General advices 

All general advices concerning minor powers apply to Greece, but since
one major alliance will be after you sooner or later, it's especially
vital to manage efficiently every resource you have.

-   Never research ahead of time, excepted if you have blueprints
    beforehand (and only in vital fields, like infantry).
-   Don't try to upgrade your army to the latest model available (unless
    it's a matter of life or death) : your IC is limited and it's way
    cheaper to upgrade them when they are "twice obsolete" (e.g. upgrade
    all your army to the 1936 standard when you have researched the 1939
    standard). Consequence : always research new infantry models as soon
    as reasonably possible.
-   Don't build more infantry than you can use : if the war is overseas,
    don't cripple your IC by building tens of divisions if your navy can
    not ship them safely.
-   Watch carefully your manpower pool. As far as defense goes, good
    land forts save you lots of manpower.
-   Be especially careful when engaging a country that enjoys a powerful
    air force, since you probably won't have one. Never let one or two
    divisions alone in the wild, or enemy CAS will bomb them into
    oblivion instantly.
-   Use the gearing bonus! While virtue is its own reward, the gearing
    bonus is the reward of a good planning. Plan things ahead, then run
    the number of item you want to produce in one row with full IC
    allowed to the construction. It's a lifesaver for minor countries!
    For example, after the 7th item produced, you'll enjoy a 35%
    discount on the build time for the rest of the series. Especially
    useful for: garrison divisions, land forts (if you want to reach
    level 10), destroyers, artillery brigades, infantry etc.

And naturally, check your available ministers every year : a few good
ones kick in at mid-game...

##  Tips and strategies to take a good start 

###    Don't be a bully 

All countries surrounding you have their independance guaranteed by at
least one major alliance (excepted Albania). Put the good old "Warmonger
Rampage From The Start Doctrine" (tm) in the closet, you won't need it
this time !

  

###  Make friends 

If you do nothing about world politics from the start of the game, Italy
will go to war against you, then Germany. Knowing that, it's better to
make a few friends beforehand.

Since you start "paternal autocrat", you can either join the Allies or
the Axis. Both will accept you into their alliance even if they are at
peace, if your relation with them reaches a decent level, like +140.

To achieve that, trade supplies for money from the start of the game.
While you're at it, boost your relation with your future ally to +200,
since once you are allied, you will want to buy blueprints and raw
materials : a maxed out relation with you new friends will grant you
huge discounts on the long run.

You can trade supplies for raw materials until the war starts. If you
plan to leave your alliance and wage the war alone, it's vital to have a
large stockpile. If you plan to stay with your allies, don't exhaust
yourself by buying raw materials : your allies will probably help you
for free if you're using more than you're producing. Use the IC for more
important matters.

  

###  Industrialize 

The decent army and land forts you start with will buy you security at
home until 1939 or 1940. Use the peacetime years to build 5 factories :
by the start of 1939 you'll have 20 IC, and a second tech team will be
available. Things are looking better already!

  

###  Win the Spanish Civil War 

There will be a war close to your home, and you don't want to miss it.
It's an excellent occasion to train your troops and leaders while taking
no risk for yourself. More over, the spanish navy is not excessively
powerful, and you should be able to ferry troops without loosing to much
naval battles.

You can choose any side in the war, depending on which alliance you plan
to join later on. Note that if you guarantee the independence of
Republican Spain, you can declare war against Nat. Spain as soon as the
Spanish civil war begins, with no dissent hit. Also note that you can
guarantee the Nationalists as soon as they appear and DOW the Rep. with
no dissent hit.

Acquier as much experience as you can while loosing as few men as
possible : defend rough terrains, or attack week enemy positions... At
the end of the war you should have several level 2 or 3 field marshals,
and your divisions will have 1, 2 or even 3 "stars of experience".

If the war does not go well, join your alliance. The French won't leave
a chance to Nat. Spain if you go Allies (resp. the Germans will land and
annex Rep. Spain if you go Axis). Then your new Spanish friends will
join your alliance. Rejoice.

Nota: another possibility is that the friendly spanish side gets
annexed: your goal then becomes to grab as much land from Spain as
possible before your major ally invades and annexes.

###  Fortress Greece 

Once you have discovered Advanced Construction Engineering (not before!)
start filling in the gap in Larisa : a level 10 land fort there will
probably be your life insurance sooner or later. If possible, expand the
level 5 forts in Ioaninna and Salonika to level 9 (max available in
those provinces). Once this is done, 3 to 6 Garrison divisions in each
province will be enough to deter almost any enemy. Remember to garrison
the beaches also : 2 or 3 Garrison divisions (depending if the terrain
is hills or plains) should be enough. If you have spare IC, 1 or 2
levels of coastal forts will make the "Fortres Greece" inviolable. Now
your homeland is safe, and you still have spare manpower : you can
divert your army to offensive tasks!

  

###    Don't forget the Navy! 

The Navy is an essential element of the Greek strategy.

-   If you're Allied or independent, the Wehrmacht will descend into the
    Balkans in 1941, and, hopefully, stop at the gates of your home-made
    Greek Maginot Line... But there is no way that you can succesfully
    counter-attack against the bulk of the Axis forces in the Balkans -
    you'll have to accept the stalemate in Greece (for now at least) and
    fight in Africa or in the "soft underbelly of Europe", Italy (and
    later, eventually, in occupied France)
-   If you're Axis, you'll want to fight in Egypt and in the
    Middle-East, or even land in the USSR (excepted if you're content to
    be Germany's pawn during Barbarossa and only send footsoldiers).

Let's face it: the war will be waged overseas, so, better be prepared.
You may have no hope to defeat the Kriegsmarine/Royal Navy head on:
basically, what you want is a navy strong enough to:

-   win a minor encounter while suffering minimal losses (e.g. a couple
    of destroyers or subs marauding)
-   protect your transport during the first few hours of a major
    encounter so that you can escape relatively safely.

Fortunately, you have a good tech team that will research new ship
models quickly - even quicker if you could trade for blueprints. My
advice : build 4 to 6 DD-IV (as soon as available) then 2 to 4 CA-IV.
Don't forget transports and supply convoys!

###  Win the Battle of France 

**Allies**

If you're Allied, it's the real crossroads of the game - if France
falls, Germany will send its army into the Balkans, and Greece will feel
very lonely very soon. That does not mean game over though: if you had
time to build your "Maginot Line" with land forts level 9 or 10 in
Ioaninna, Larisa and Salonika (and to garrison them properly), you can
stalemate the German offensive indefinitely. You will then have to help
the Allies on other battlefields until Germany bends under a might
greater than hers - this will be a long road but maybe someday you'll
have the pleasure to count among Europe's liberators!

But: if you want to take the short way towards victory, you must win the
battle of France.

If you already won the Spanish Civil War with Rep. Spain, now they
should be Allied, and have sent many divisions to the Franco-Belgian
border. The Spanish forces are a nice addition to the French ones, and
if you place strategically the 6 to 10 Greek divisions that you can send
abroad it becomes possible to win the Battle of France. Or, at least, to
stalemate it so that it turns into a war of attrition, effectively
neutralizing the German threat (playtested, without any gamey exploit -
it works ;) )

If you survive this long, use or create a small navy and move toward
Italy. If the have the Libyan coast covered, land in British navel bases
close to the middle east and try to grab some southern Libyan provinces.
If the italians are beat out in libya or if its looking like it than
head south toward Ethopia. once there, grab as much of it as you can.
Don't rush it if the Italians won out in africa. ( I have only seen the
Italians win out once, so you have great odds.

My advice: place your divisions in Brussels, Namur or Reims, and make
them "support attack" against the most likely enemy target. They will
take part to battles involving 40+ divisions and earn huge amounts of
experience, while saving the Free World altogether. What's not to
love? ;)

**Axis**

If you're Axis, the Germans handle the Battle of France rather well on
their own: your aim will be to grab as much land as possible in North
Africa / Syria / Southern France before the armistice.

If Nat. Spain is your ally, it may be a good idea to help them take
Gibraltar beforehand: that should increase the life expectancy of your
navy significantly and therefore increase your gains...

###  Aftermath 

Once this is done, you have almost unlimited possibilities about what to
do next...

As Allies, you can push into Germany along with the French, and attempt
landings of your own if you want to claim your share of land -
eventually you may be able to liberate Denmark or Norway as a Greek
puppet, for example. Then, remember that there is a war to win in Asia
against Japan!

As Axis, you can prepare Barbarossa, or alternatively try to conquer
Africa, the Middle-East and even India from the British.

Whatever path you choose, remember to build enough supply convoys and
escorts if you want to be able to hold Greek beachheads anywhere in the
world!

###  A word about land doctrines 

You start with the Firepower focus, and your only tech team dedicated to
land doctrines is only really efficient if you follow the Grand Battle
Plan path.

This path is weak during the early game, but can become really powerful
during the late game (after 1944)especially if your choose the
Infiltration Assault path, which yields a very high morale score for
your divisions (i.e. fast org. regain, really useful for offensives).

A country with a rather small army like Greece would perhaps be better
off with the Mobility/Blitzkrieg path which yields higher org values,
but the fact that it's harder to research and that your tech team is
weaker for this path should make you think twice before you choose this
path.

  

###  A word about sliders 

A clever move is to make 2 or 3 steps towards Central Planning: you'll
receive +15% or +20% IC. Then I suggest all the way towards Hawk Lobby
to have the production discounts. Finally, move the slider towards
Standing Army: since you'll likely follow the Grand Battle Plan path,
every little boost to the org. of your divisions is welcome.
