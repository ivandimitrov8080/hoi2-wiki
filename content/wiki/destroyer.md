The Destroyer is the smallest and the fastest of the surface ships. It
is lightly armed in comparison with the battleship, but its speed and
maneuvrability allow it to provide a good first line of defence away
from the main capital ships of a fleet, and its light guns are useful
for engaging aircraft. Destroyers are usually combined in groups and
used for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.
