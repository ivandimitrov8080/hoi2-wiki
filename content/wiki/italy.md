##  Overview 

Italy has the potential to dominate the Mediterranean theatre, but is
hampered by a lack of everything: good tech teams, industry, resources,
and skilled military leadership.

It is imperative to make some choices right at the beginning. Do you
want to immediately go on a small conquering spree, putting you in an
ahistorically strong position (if you do not get DoW'd by the entire
Balkans and Turkey, or let alone the major powers)? Will you depend on
Germany to give you the support to defend your home while most of your
forces are conquering Egypt? Should you defend or abandon Ethiopia?

Italy is one of the most fun countries to play since it has enough
handicaps and plenty of potential. It is easy to overextend, and when
you do, you are at the mercy of the magical allied magnifying glass. If
it focuses on you, rather than the action in France or the Far East,
Rome will burn.

Guide](/Italy_1941_Strategy_Guide "Italy 1941 Strategy Guide")

##  Technology 

Italy begins the game with only four research slots, thus a common first
objective is to expand to the fifth research slot, which is possible
once base IC is 80. This can most rapidly be achieved through a
combination of IC building and an early annexation of Spain. Italy has
average technology teams, thus only limited branches of technology can
effectively be researched.

For land doctrine, some players choose to completely abandon the
"Firepower Focus" land doctrines, widely considered among the weakest
doctrine in the game. If you stick to it and go for the Infiltration
Assault path in ´42 you get the best infantry available from ´43 on, due
to the high night attack bonus you will receive. Until then you will
have relatively poor organization and morale. Within the Mobility Focus
doctrine, Human Wave is a good choice for Italy, with a level 4 tech
team with four specialties in many branches, especially late game. The
most common choice, however, is Spearhead Doctrine. With an early
alliance with Germany, blueprints for the entire tech tree can be
typically acquired long in advance of the historical year, making the
research reasonably rapid even with Italy's inferior teams. Italy needs
to also focus on Manufacturing, Infantry, with limited Naval and Air.
Within Naval, generally Battleships and Destroyers should be the focus,
and within Air TAC/NAV is a necessary limitation.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

Italy's first possible ally is Ethiopia, in the event Italy sues for
peace and forces Ethiopia to become a puppet. Italy's natural
ideological ally is Germany, and joining the Axis is possible as early
as 1936. This is extremely advantageous for Italy to do, as it grants
them many key blueprints and free resources. Once Italy has joined the
Axis, all future alliances are contingent on Germany, as leader of the
alliance. If you plan to wage some earlier wars be careful not to ruin
the important German events, so be at peace from spring ´38 on for
Anschluss and the following events. Also be warned that Germany going to
war unhistorical early triggers (in Armageddon) one of the US events
that removes some of their peacetime IC penalty. If you don´t plan to
wage early wars it is better for Axis if you finish Ethiopia before you
join.

Italy can also create some early puppets through liberation:

-   Ethiopia
-   Libya
-   Somalia

Although Libya and Somalia have no factories with they will
automatically have 5 IC (off map) when liberated. On first look,
liberation may look good to save TC and provide extra units to hold the
beaches. However, the problem is that you could get up to 25% dissent as
a result (anger at colonial policy event: DD & ARMA). As a result,
liberation of nations is not considered a wise strategy.

###  Sliders 

Italy begins the game with very poor slider positions: as a general
rule, the game favors extreme positions, and Italy begins with many
moderate settings. Italy will not receive much slider help either, with
only three free Interventionism slider moves (1936 Spanish Civil war,
1937 Anti-Comintern pact, 1939 Albania). The best opening move for Italy
is Hawk moves in 1936, 1937, and 1938, which will bring full Hawk. In
1939, an Interventionism move would assure full interventionism by March
of that year due to Albania.

Players may instead use 1939 to begin the long march to Central
Planning. This requires 6 moves, thus starting in 1939 would finish in
January, 1944. Since Germany is frequently influencing Italy, it is
possible, but unlikely, for Germany to have a "complete influence" event
that assists with this slider. This is generally a better choice than
the Standing Army move, since that will require 7 moves, and Italy
arguably needs IC more than organisation and experience bonuses.

###  Ministers 

Italy has excellent starting Ministers.

In 1940, Minister of Security Umberto Albini will become available. For
an Italy that holds many foreign territories (France, Spain, Greece,
etc), changing to this minister with 15% foreign IC use is very
beneficial.

##  Economy 

Italy has the weakest economy out of all the major nations (USA, USSR,
Germany, Japan, and the UK). This puts Italy at a significant
disadvantage over the course of the game, and creates an added challenge
for players.

###  Trading 

Italy begins the game with supply deficits, and a few existing trade
deals. The existing deals help Italy stay barely ahead with Rare
materials, while around 30 energy and 10 metal is lost every day. This
means that without trade deals, Italy will immediately begin suffering
shortages affecting Industry in February, 1936. Italy's best trading
partners (in order):

-   Germany
-   Soviet Union
-   Sweden
-   Siam
-   Japan

###  Industrial Production 

Italy will never be an industrial powerhouse, owing to its weak starting
position. Italy's first production goal, however, is industrial
improvement to attain the fifth technology team slot. This requires a
minimum of 80 base IC. Italy is able to begin the game with 7 parallel
factories in construction. After the first run is complete, five more
factories can be added. How many serial runs factories should be
produced depend on a player's Italian strategy.

If Italy will join the Axis in 1936, this means the war will begin
August 30, 1939. Italy shares borders with both France and the UK's
colonial holdings, thus Italy must be militarily prepared, especially if
it wants to excel in warfare. This means a two serial run of a 7
parallel factories (ending in December, 1937) is a good starting point,
possibly with a few more factories to get Italy over the 80 IC base
threshold. This will provide a 20 month for a strong military build up.

If Italy will not join the Axis until 1941, Italy essentially has two
additional years for IC building and manpower growing. This additional
IC can bring Italy an extra 20 base IC.

##  Military 

###  Army 

While the mainstay of the Italian army must be
[infantry](/Infantry "Infantry") and
[militia](/Militia_Strategy_Guide "Militia Strategy Guide") , Italy can
greatly benefit from specialization. The Balkans and Turkey, for
example, are significantly helped with mountaineers. Mountaineers can
continue to be used in a war against the Soviet Union, both in the
Caucasus region, but also Mountaineers have significant bonuses when
fighting in Arctic conditions. Marines are essential for Jungle fighting
in the resource rich Central African region, if Italy so chooses. A
Paratrooper division can help since Italy starts with a Transport
Aircraft, and can have limited use.

Generally, Italy does not have the resources (or more importantly: the
TC) for tank building. A few limited Motorized Infantry units with
SP-ART, followed by Mechanized units, can be beneficial. Cavalry with AC
is also helpful for fast operations, and does not consume as much TC.
Cavalry is specifically helpful when attacking Southern USSR, and taking
vast tracks of land relatively quickly.

####  Leaders 

As usual, Italy is the weakest of the major powers in this aspect as
well. However, they're more than adequate and used properly will work
just fine. Army wise, you got about two dozen leaders that will top out
at skill levels of 5 or higher. Between Messe, Zingali and Bitossi you
should have your armored needs covered, and you got a handful leaders
who share both Winter Specialist and Commando traits and make for
excellent mountaineer leaders.

Your starting position is terrible, with just Messe and Balbo over skill
level 2. The rest of your commanders will need a lot of practice, or
you'll be stuck with yet another disadvantage to the other majors.

###  Navy 

In HOI2 DD, the best main battle fleet composition for Italy's limited
resources is comprised of CA (Heavy cruisers) with CVL (light carriers)
and DD (destroyers). This is an effective combination of good firepower,
and a fleet size of 8 CA + 8 DD + 2 CVL can be effective in a fight
against the carriers of the Royal Navy. Additionally, this type of fleet
moves fast, and is very cheap to build and repair. In HOI2 Armageddon
firecontrol brigades for the DD´s are a very nice thing, as you will get
very cheap cruizerg fleets, as the FC give 10km additional range when
you upgraded them after you researched the Advanced Computing Machine.
More about cruizerg fleets can be found here: [Surface Action
Group](/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") . Four firecontrol
brigades for the starting BB´s in combination with one of the best
leaders you have enables them to destroy many enemy ships very
effectively at maximum range, so your own ships don´t take damage. This
way, you can also take down the old French and British BB´s.

In addition, Italy will greatly benefit from a wolfpack strategy if it
is going to fight any Allied nation (obviously against the USSR this
isn't necessary). Build submarines (1938 level) for convoy raiding
missions, and you will greatly reduce the fighting ability of Allied
troops whereever you engage them. If you choose an African strategy, for
example, the British can be fairly easily overrun (it will still take a
long time, however) with successful convoy raiding. As South Africa,
Free France and Iraq usually deliver supplies to the Brits they may
suffer from supply shortage, but in Armageddon it is not really possible
to cut the Brits off from supplies totally. With an extensive sub
campaign you will be able to sink many, many convoys and that is
definitely a nice thing, but you won´t starve the troops in Africa. As
Fleet in Being is the worst naval doctrine path for subs be warned that
your subs are effective early in the game but will have a very bad time
from ´41/´42 on as the Allies will have doctrine advantage and better
destroyers by then.

###  Air Force 

Italy does not have the industrial capacity to produce a large air
force. It is possible, however, to produce a limited air force to
fulfill particular roles. Tactical bombers (TAC) and Naval bombers are
very well suited for Italy's theaters of war, and are highly
recommended. Interceptors are not as important, and likely beyond
Italy's limited resources.

If you plan to play a longer game interceptors or fighters are a must
have for Italy, as the Allies will bomb Europe to death from ´41 on if
you are defenceless. Enemy naval bombers in the Med are something you
probably do not want to tolerate (at least in Armageddon they can become
a pain in the a\*\*), so prepare to do something against them.

##  War 

Unlike all other major powers who have very clear adversaries that must
be challenged, Italy does not have any direct opponents. This allows an
Italian player to choose their own path with a great deal of
flexibility. The most essential sphere of warfare for Italy is the
Mediterranean Sea, best managed through Gibraltar in the West and Suez
in the East. Control of the Mediterranean is vital to the defense of
Italy's home shores, and enables Italy free movement throughout Northern
Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. Historically, Africa was
an important theater of war due to Italian holdings in Libya and
Ethiopia, yet involvement in Africa is a questionable strategy in-game.

###  Italo-Ethiopian War 

The game begins with Italy at war with Ethiopia. It is quite easy to
direct Italian units straight to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, and
win the war. With Italian units in the capital, the player has two
choices for resolving the war:

-   Annex Ethiopia outright, and gain two IC, and enough resources to
    support those two IC.
-   Sue for peace with Ethiopia, and demand they become a puppet. This
    avoids dissent caused by annexation and then liberation (DD & ARMA),
    and it also keeps the Ethiopian army intact. This will allow
    Ethiopia to have an army of around 15 divisions by the fall of 1939,
    which can be military controlled by Italy.

If you don't mind the gamey-ness, keeping the war with Ethiopia going
for a while has numerous benefits. Militia on militia action is
excellent training for your commanders, and consumer goods demand will
stay low as long as you're at war. Attack with a few militia divisions,
and add more as the fight progresses and your troops start to get beat
up. A good battle will last a week. You can use your naval bombers on
Interdiction missions to get them valuble experience without doing much
damage to the ethiopians. All in all, you can get your army a decent
experience boost, half a dozen (the good ones) leaders up to skill level
6-7 and another dozen or two a couple levels higher without commiting
more than a few weeks of manpower production - and Italy doesn't have
the IC to use all that manpower anyway.

###  Spanish Civil War 

On July 18, 1936, the Spanish Civil War will occur. Playing as an Axis
nation means the odds are stacked against the Nationalists, who will
likely loose. Italy should always send help, via the in-game event, to
Nationalist Spain to avoid 5 dissent and an isolationist move. Beyond
that event, Italy has three practical choices:

-   Do nothing and let the Nationalists loose.
-   Assist the Nationalists in regaining their country by declaring war
    on Republican Spain at the beginning of the war
-   Wait until the Nationalists have been defeated (between 6 - 18
    months), and invade Republican Spain in order to annex it. An
    annexed Spain will provide 8 IC, 39 energy, 18 rares, and 28 metal.
    This is particularly helpful since Italy is short on all major
    resources. Note that Spain is key to capturing Gibraltar, which is
    imperative for achieving strategic control of the Mediterranean Sea.
    Also note that Spain provides a second front against France when
    Fall Weiss occurs.

###  Albanian Occupation 

At the end of March, 1939 (following the German invasion of
Czechoslovakia) Italy will have the option to give King Zog an ultimatum
regarding annexation. While Albania does not offer significant value, it
provides Italy a foothold in the Balkans, and a staging point for
possible actions in Greece and Yugoslavia. Taking Albania is simple,
since it does not produce troops (DD & ARMA).

###  Early opportunities for war 

Italy has several nonaggression pacts with its neighbors, which
considerably reduce Italy's opportunity for local war mongering. All
these non-aggression pacts, however, will eventually expire:

-   January, 1939: Pact with Turkey expires. An Italy with a high
    belligerence, however, will likely cause a Soviet DOW if Italy
    decides to attack Turkey.
-   March, 1939: Pact with Greece expires. After the annexation of
    Albania at the end of March, Greece is a fairly easy target. Romania
    will likely declare war as a result.
-   June, 1939: Pact with France expires. Italy may find France
    challenging if they are not in the Axis. If Italy is in the Axis,
    and early war with France will spoil the war with Poland.

###  Fall Weiss 

The German invasion of Poland in August 30, 1939 is an important date
for Italy, either as an early warning of the wider war soon to come, or
as the beginning of open conflict with the Allies due to an early join
with the Axis. Italy has several important military objectives:

-   Secure the Mediterranean Sea by taking Gibraltar and Suez.
-   Defend Italian borders with France, possibly lead offensive assaults
    into France.
-   Resolve North Africa strategy: abandon Libya and Egypt or engage in
    a North African campaign

###  Sitzkrieg 

After the invasion of Poland, Europe goes quiet for quite some time.
Italy has a few options during this lull, starting with Yugoslavia.
Italy has claims on Yugoslavian territories. Since Yugoslavia has
several guarantees of independence, an early declaration of war (before
1939) is risky, and could embroil Italy into WWII with the Allies
attacking, or could trigger war from Turkey, Greece, or even Germany.
Therefore, war with Yugoslavia should only occur after Fall Weiss,
and/or after Italy is prepared to go to war with the Allies. Full
annexation of Yugoslavia within three weeks is achievable. With 25 total
IC, Italy will gain 5 base IC in normal conditions, or 9 base IC in the
event that Albini is the Minister of Security.

If Northern Africa has been successfully secured, a campaign against
Southern Africa can be fruitful. No Italian controlled port is within
3000 km of South Africa, and taking Italian troops on ground throughout
the length of Africa could easily take years. Thus, an alternate (quite
challenging) method is to capture the Diego Garcia Island (from Port
Massaua). This port island can take transports within range of Durban.
While South Africa is not heavily guarded (SA has extremely low
manpower), landing will be difficult.

##  Strategy 

Strategically, Italy has two primary objectives:

-   Control the Mediterranean Sea (Gibraltar & Suez).
-   Ensure the Soviet Union is defeated.

An Italy that achieves both objectives can play a significant role in
ensuring the Axis rules the world. If either objective fails, Italy is
almost certainly doomed.

###  Mediterranean Control 

The most important key to a successful Italy is control of the
Mediterranean. The most effective way to control the Mediterranean is
through the capture of Gibraltar and Suez, preventing any new allied
ships from entering the Mediterranean. With that accomplished, the
remaining UK fleet will need to be destroyed, since the French fleet
will disappear with the fall of France by Germany.

In HOI2, the most effective way to destroy the Royal Navy is through
maintaining air superiority over the Mediterranean and making good use
of Naval Bombers. By using Naval Bombers you will slowly whittle down
the Royal Navy and after a series of heavy Port Strikes on Gibraltar,
Malta and the Egyptian coast, the RN may well be grounded and you will
be able to roam freely across the Med.

In DD & ARMA, control of the Mediterranean is more challenging. First, a
Northern African campaign that removes all ports, including those in the
Middle East, will considerably help. Next, waiting for several months as
the Royal Navy runs out of supplies and oil helps greatly amplify
Italy's tiny Naval force. Then, Naval bombers will help soften up the
Royal Naval. Finally, Italy's starting navy can begin to sink the Royal
Navy.

###  European Strategy 

On this path, Italy's warfare focuses almost exclusively on the European
theater, putting little, if any, resources into Africa. This could mean
early war with Spain, Greece, and Yugoslavia. This path also requires
Italian involvement in the war against the Soviet Union, to ensure
Germany wins. This can be accomplished by joining German forces on their
front lines, or by opening up a new front against the Soviet Union. One
way to create a new front is to invade and Annex Turkey, which will
provide Italy direct access to the Baku, oil rich region, in addition
the the Black Sea. This strategy requires emphasis on land and bomber
forces, and will entirely neglect the Navy. Italy's most pressing need
when fighting the Soviet Union will be manpower, due to the sheer size
of the land and number of Soviet divisions. A quick victory is
imperative for the Axis. When manpower has been exhausted, focus on IC
intensive units such as the air force. After the defeat of the Soviet
Union, a Navy should be built.

###  African Strategy 

Most of Africa is an infrastructure nightmare, meaning that troops will
be low on combat efficiency (ESE), TC will be considerably stressed, and
moving troops will be extremely slow: moving from one province to the
next may take months!

Africa has some strategic value:

-   Northern Africa has airbases that the Allies can be use to pester
    your forces.
-   Northern Africa also has ports, and while the Royal Navy may be
    trapped after Italy controls the Mediterranean Sea, they will still
    be in supply, and able to harass the Italian navy.
-   Central and Southern Africa have some good resources, including
    metals and rares.

An effective Africa strategy can be conducted with the following steps:

-   Ensure Ethiopia is a puppet, and take military control of their
    armies. Use their armies to grab as much land in Africa as possible.
-   Limit Italian military involvement.
-   Use Infantry and Militia, don´t use MOT, MEC, ARM in the central
    African jungles and never use CAV in Africa.
-   For Central Africa, use Marines if possible; for Southern Africa,
    use Mountaineers.

###  Fortress Italy 

In this strategy, Italy essentially ignores the rest of the world,
refuses to join the Axis or the Allies, and simply fortifies its home
lands. This means abandoning Libya for pragmatic reasons.

Securing Italy's beaches is a relatively easy task, although it will
require a fair amount of time and effort. Italy has a large number of
beaches, which can be quite strongly secured with a three unit stack of:
(a) infantry division plus artillery; (b) militia; (c) militia. Make a
note of the "crossroads" provinces, ones that border 3 beach provinces.
Perugia and Potenza are best. These are the provinces for Italy to store
reaction forces: Armoured, motorized, mechanized, calvary, etc. With
their speed, use them to rapidly reinforce beach defenders using the
"support defense" mission. A Navy is not important since beaches can be
more efficiently defended, and no Italian Navy could match the Royal
Navy or the USN.

The most vulnerable location for Italy are its land borders. Eventually,
the Soviet Union and the Allies will be on those borders, and they may
declare war. Therefore, land forts are a necessity along Italy's
Northern borders, combined with a strong emphasis on Interceptors.

###  Italy the Traitor 

Italy can join the Allies! Most players would consider this gamey, just
as attacking Germany or the USA in 1936, for example, is gamey. In any
event, an Italy that joins the Allies, especially in the fall of 1941
when Germany has all forces on the Eastern front, can score an easy
victory for Italy.

###  Roman Strategy 

It is possible to get a 20th century Roman Empire. No doubt this is very
gamey and ahistorical, but given Italy's numerous handicaps it is also
quite a feat to accomplish. At the start of the game, make peace with
Ethiopia and forget about them and Somalia for the rest of the game.
Your troops will be spread thin enough as it is whithout defending their
useless deserts. Start building two factories, and allocate the rest of
your IC to reinforcements and upgrades while you shuttle your troops
back from Ethiopia. You'll want to build around 10 factories as early as
possible - that'll give you the 5th research slot when you annex Spain.
Don't cancel the light cruiser that starts in your production queue, it
is only 16 days from completion. Change your ministers to maximize IC
and manpower bonuses. You will not join the Axis, as it would be a
disgrace for the noble Romans to seek any sort of agreement with the
Germanic barbarians. Merely sharing common enemies with them will be
enough.

Ressearch will be focused on industrial techs at first. The cryptography
techs are a must, even if they take forever to ressearch thanks to your
bad tech teams. You also want the 1936 manpower techs as early as
possible. You want to get to the small arms assembly line ASAP, and that
means non-stop ressearch in this field. For your military you will need
infantry, mountaineers, militia and cavalry. You'll never have enough TC
to support large motorized formations so you might as well not try.
Artillery will also be useful (and possibly SP-Art for your cav divs) to
augment the strength of your relatively small armies.

Once these essential techs are ressearched far enough down the tree you
can do Interceptors and Tac bombers, along with some air and naval
doctrines. Just keep in mind that no matter how much effort you put into
these, you'll always be a step behind your main opponents. Do not
abandon your land doctrine. The infiltration assault path is perfectly
suited to the forces you are going to field. Anyways you won't ally with
Germany so it won't be possible to get all the blueprints for the
spearhead doctrine. The diplomacy sliders should be moved to full hawk
first, and then begin to move to full standing army. After that it
doesn't matter that much since you'll either have won or lost the game.
It will pay off to set the sliders to generate extra money and engage
heavily in intelligence activities (to steal blueprints).

Your army should be organized into army corps of Mil/Inf/Inf. Militia is
key as it bolsters your ranks significantly and you only have so much
manpower to spare. Your navy is obsolete but some of it will be useful
in shore bombardment duties. Assemble an 18 ship SAG with your 4 BBI's
and 5 CAIII's, plus your 9 best screens. Then put some sort of a
transport fleet together with the CAII'S and CLII's as protection, and
disband anything that's left over. Submarines can be kept as they can be
useful as pickets. Keep your starting air force, as it will be a long
time before you can spare the IC to build more.

After your troops are reinforced and upgraded to 1936 infantry, you're
ready to invade and annex Spain. This will open up a second front
against France - which you will need. Once Spain is yours, you must
build up your army as much as possible before the outbreak of WWII. Send
some spies into France and build at least as many infantry divisions as
they will (you can count your militia as an infantry div. for that
purpose).

Guarantee the independence of germany so that when France and the UK
declare war on them, you can DOW them without suffering dissent. When
the war breaks out, you must beat Germany into France and deny them any
conquests there. It really is a race against the clock, because you
essentially need to wrap up the war before winter or the German
blitzkrieg in the spring of 1940 will deny northern France to the
greatness of Rome. Conquering France can be difficult, as they are
likely to have a doctrine and cryptography lead on you. In fact the war
with France is the most likely point where this strategy will break
down. To secure victory you will most certainly need to have an
excellent grasp of the combat mechanics and use every advantage you can.
Since you're not allied with the german barbarians, Vichy France will
not trigger and you'll get to keep it all.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you can find the spare cash to
influence them you might be able to bribe the Axis minors into allying
with you instead of Germany. This will really turn the tide against
Hitler and when the time comes you'll be glad to have them with you
instead of against you.

Don't forget to leave some troops in Africa to push the brits back to
Suez and also a few divs in Spain to quickly seize Gibraltar. A goal of
sealing off the Mediterranean before the new year is reasonable. Once
France has fallen, redeploy your troops to Venice and launch an
offensive into the Balkans. Again you need to do this before the germans
have a chance to try so don't wait any longer than you need. You want to
annex Yugoslavia and Greece. If you've gotten to this point, all there
is left is Turkey and every province bordering the Med will be green.
However you should probably wait until Germany is at war with the Soviet
Union before declaring war upon the Turks. Since you'll have sky-high
beligerence by then, your DOW might trigger them into attacking you.
Common sense dictates that a war against both of these behemoths could
only end badly for Rome. If they do declare war, at least they'll also
be fighting each other so the situation will be a little more
manageable.

Now assuming that you avoided war with Germany and the SU, there is one
last nut to crack: Londinium. Before you can safely try this you need to
modernize your navy and build a sufficiently strong surface fleet to
support the landing, which will likely take years. Look up the German
strategy page if you need to know more about invading England. So
essentially you're left with a lot of time to kill and a huge empire to
pacify so you'll likely need to build lots of garrison divs. You may
want to try to take France's overseas territories (so you can annex
them) and keep your military on guard in Africa and the Middle-East as a
British offensive from Iraq is not completely out of the question. In
fact taking Iraq would be a good thing to do to occupy your time as your
new navy is being built. Speaking of which - a 30 ship SAG of 13 CA'S, 2
CVL's and 15 DD's (all 1941 models) should be up to the task. If you're
lucky you'll have captured some transports from the french ports, but
most likely you'll need to build some of those as well.

After England has fallen you will have most of the land that was
historically comprised in the Roman Empire. At this point, depending on
the strategic situation in Europe, you might want to try to take on
Germany. If they're losing on the eastern front (which they most likely
will, considering you have denied them almost everything else), it might
be possible to blitz into their industrial heartland and cripple them
significantly before they have a chance to bring reaction forces back
from the East.

There is also the possibility that your conquests confuse the German AI
enough that it will never attack the soviets. In that case you need to
keep in mind that you will face 150+ divs and that the germans will have
a huge doctrine advantage on you until you ressearch the 'infiltration
in depth' tech. Assuming everything has gone as planned your army is
probably around 100 div strong at this point, so a considerable
expansion will be required. Another problem arises from the fact that
your army is almost entirely soft and that you have nothing to counter
the german armor effectively. Building armor is not an option because TC
is already way too overloaded, so the best bet is probably to build some
of the otherwise useless AT brigades for your infantry. This will give
your army some punch against the panzer divs without adding more TC
load. Moreover, infantry divs brigaded with AT will retain full benefits
from the infiltration doctrine while armor would not.

Alternatively, although this is beyond gamey, you can edit a saved game
and add all your new conquests as national territories (simulating a
unified Roman Empire). This will bump your IC into the 300's, quell all
dissent, and turn your TC back to a 'green' figure (and you probably
haven't seen that since 1938). Now you can safely take on Germany and
the SU. At the same time.

Addendum : After some testing, the general strategy was shown to work.
In the test game the war with France was nearly disastrous but succeeded
in the end. Turkey can be attacked/annexed before 1941 and Germany had
almost defeated the Soviet Union when I attacked - and successfuly
defeated - it.

##  Overview 

Italy has the potential to dominate the Mediterranean theatre, but is
hampered by a lack of everything: good tech teams, industry, resources,
and skilled military leadership.

It is imperative to make some choices right at the beginning. Do you
want to immediately go on a small conquering spree, putting you in an
ahistorically strong position (if you do not get DoW'd by the entire
Balkans and Turkey, or let alone the major powers)? Will you depend on
Germany to give you the support to defend your home while most of your
forces are conquering Egypt? Should you defend or abandon Ethiopia?

Italy is one of the most fun countries to play since it has enough
handicaps and plenty of potential. It is easy to overextend, and when
you do, you are at the mercy of the magical allied magnifying glass. If
it focuses on you, rather than the action in France or the Far East,
Rome will burn.

[Italy 1941 Strategy
Guide](/Italy_1941_Strategy_Guide "Italy 1941 Strategy Guide")

##  Technology 

Italy begins the game with only four research slots, thus a common first
objective is to expand to the fifth research slot, which is possible
once base IC is 80. This can most rapidly be achieved through a
combination of IC building and an early annexation of Spain. Italy has
average technology teams, thus only limited branches of technology can
effectively be researched.

For land doctrine, some players choose to completely abandon the
"Firepower Focus" land doctrines, widely considered among the weakest
doctrine in the game. If you stick to it and go for the Infiltration
Assault path in ´42 you get the best infantry available from ´43 on, due
to the high night attack bonus you will receive. Until then you will
have relatively poor organization and morale. Within the Mobility Focus
doctrine, Human Wave is a good choice for Italy, with a level 4 tech
team with four specialties in many branches, especially late game. The
most common choice, however, is Spearhead Doctrine. With an early
alliance with Germany, blueprints for the entire tech tree can be
typically acquired long in advance of the historical year, making the
research reasonably rapid even with Italy's inferior teams. Italy needs
to also focus on Manufacturing, Infantry, with limited Naval and Air.
Within Naval, generally Battleships and Destroyers should be the focus,
and within Air TAC/NAV is a necessary limitation.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Alliances 

Italy's first possible ally is Ethiopia, in the event Italy sues for
peace and forces Ethiopia to become a puppet. Italy's natural
ideological ally is Germany, and joining the Axis is possible as early
as 1936. This is extremely advantageous for Italy to do, as it grants
them many key blueprints and free resources. Once Italy has joined the
Axis, all future alliances are contingent on Germany, as leader of the
alliance. If you plan to wage some earlier wars be careful not to ruin
the important German events, so be at peace from spring ´38 on for
Anschluss and the following events. Also be warned that Germany going to
war unhistorical early triggers (in Armageddon) one of the US events
that removes some of their peacetime IC penalty. If you don´t plan to
wage early wars it is better for Axis if you finish Ethiopia before you
join.

Italy can also create some early puppets through liberation:

-   Ethiopia
-   Libya
-   Somalia

Although Libya and Somalia have no factories with they will
automatically have 5 IC (off map) when liberated. On first look,
liberation may look good to save TC and provide extra units to hold the
beaches. However, the problem is that you could get up to 25% dissent as
a result (anger at colonial policy event: DD & ARMA). As a result,
liberation of nations is not considered a wise strategy.

###  Sliders 

Italy begins the game with very poor slider positions: as a general
rule, the game favors extreme positions, and Italy begins with many
moderate settings. Italy will not receive much slider help either, with
only three free Interventionism slider moves (1936 Spanish Civil war,
1937 Anti-Comintern pact, 1939 Albania). The best opening move for Italy
is Hawk moves in 1936, 1937, and 1938, which will bring full Hawk. In
1939, an Interventionism move would assure full interventionism by March
of that year due to Albania.

Players may instead use 1939 to begin the long march to Central
Planning. This requires 6 moves, thus starting in 1939 would finish in
January, 1944. Since Germany is frequently influencing Italy, it is
possible, but unlikely, for Germany to have a "complete influence" event
that assists with this slider. This is generally a better choice than
the Standing Army move, since that will require 7 moves, and Italy
arguably needs IC more than organisation and experience bonuses.

###  Ministers 

Italy has excellent starting Ministers.

In 1940, Minister of Security Umberto Albini will become available. For
an Italy that holds many foreign territories (France, Spain, Greece,
etc), changing to this minister with 15% foreign IC use is very
beneficial.

##  Economy 

Italy has the weakest economy out of all the major nations (USA, USSR,
Germany, Japan, and the UK). This puts Italy at a significant
disadvantage over the course of the game, and creates an added challenge
for players.

###  Trading 

Italy begins the game with supply deficits, and a few existing trade
deals. The existing deals help Italy stay barely ahead with Rare
materials, while around 30 energy and 10 metal is lost every day. This
means that without trade deals, Italy will immediately begin suffering
shortages affecting Industry in February, 1936. Italy's best trading
partners (in order):

-   Germany
-   Soviet Union
-   Sweden
-   Siam
-   Japan

###  Industrial Production 

Italy will never be an industrial powerhouse, owing to its weak starting
position. Italy's first production goal, however, is industrial
improvement to attain the fifth technology team slot. This requires a
minimum of 80 base IC. Italy is able to begin the game with 7 parallel
factories in construction. After the first run is complete, five more
factories can be added. How many serial runs factories should be
produced depend on a player's Italian strategy.

If Italy will join the Axis in 1936, this means the war will begin
August 30, 1939. Italy shares borders with both France and the UK's
colonial holdings, thus Italy must be militarily prepared, especially if
it wants to excel in warfare. This means a two serial run of a 7
parallel factories (ending in December, 1937) is a good starting point,
possibly with a few more factories to get Italy over the 80 IC base
threshold. This will provide a 20 month for a strong military build up.

If Italy will not join the Axis until 1941, Italy essentially has two
additional years for IC building and manpower growing. This additional
IC can bring Italy an extra 20 base IC.

##  Military 

###  Army 

While the mainstay of the Italian army must be
[infantry](/Infantry "Infantry") and
[militia](/Militia_Strategy_Guide "Militia Strategy Guide") , Italy can
greatly benefit from specialization. The Balkans and Turkey, for
example, are significantly helped with mountaineers. Mountaineers can
continue to be used in a war against the Soviet Union, both in the
Caucasus region, but also Mountaineers have significant bonuses when
fighting in Arctic conditions. Marines are essential for Jungle fighting
in the resource rich Central African region, if Italy so chooses. A
Paratrooper division can help since Italy starts with a Transport
Aircraft, and can have limited use.

Generally, Italy does not have the resources (or more importantly: the
TC) for tank building. A few limited Motorized Infantry units with
SP-ART, followed by Mechanized units, can be beneficial. Cavalry with AC
is also helpful for fast operations, and does not consume as much TC.
Cavalry is specifically helpful when attacking Southern USSR, and taking
vast tracks of land relatively quickly.

####  Leaders 

As usual, Italy is the weakest of the major powers in this aspect as
well. However, they're more than adequate and used properly will work
just fine. Army wise, you got about two dozen leaders that will top out
at skill levels of 5 or higher. Between Messe, Zingali and Bitossi you
should have your armored needs covered, and you got a handful leaders
who share both Winter Specialist and Commando traits and make for
excellent mountaineer leaders.

Your starting position is terrible, with just Messe and Balbo over skill
level 2. The rest of your commanders will need a lot of practice, or
you'll be stuck with yet another disadvantage to the other majors.

###  Navy 

In HOI2 DD, the best main battle fleet composition for Italy's limited
resources is comprised of CA (Heavy cruisers) with CVL (light carriers)
and DD (destroyers). This is an effective combination of good firepower,
and a fleet size of 8 CA + 8 DD + 2 CVL can be effective in a fight
against the carriers of the Royal Navy. Additionally, this type of fleet
moves fast, and is very cheap to build and repair. In HOI2 Armageddon
firecontrol brigades for the DD´s are a very nice thing, as you will get
very cheap cruizerg fleets, as the FC give 10km additional range when
you upgraded them after you researched the Advanced Computing Machine.
More about cruizerg fleets can be found here: [Surface Action
Group](/Surface_Action_Group "Surface Action Group") . Four firecontrol
brigades for the starting BB´s in combination with one of the best
leaders you have enables them to destroy many enemy ships very
effectively at maximum range, so your own ships don´t take damage. This
way, you can also take down the old French and British BB´s.

In addition, Italy will greatly benefit from a wolfpack strategy if it
is going to fight any Allied nation (obviously against the USSR this
isn't necessary). Build submarines (1938 level) for convoy raiding
missions, and you will greatly reduce the fighting ability of Allied
troops whereever you engage them. If you choose an African strategy, for
example, the British can be fairly easily overrun (it will still take a
long time, however) with successful convoy raiding. As South Africa,
Free France and Iraq usually deliver supplies to the Brits they may
suffer from supply shortage, but in Armageddon it is not really possible
to cut the Brits off from supplies totally. With an extensive sub
campaign you will be able to sink many, many convoys and that is
definitely a nice thing, but you won´t starve the troops in Africa. As
Fleet in Being is the worst naval doctrine path for subs be warned that
your subs are effective early in the game but will have a very bad time
from ´41/´42 on as the Allies will have doctrine advantage and better
destroyers by then.

###  Air Force 

Italy does not have the industrial capacity to produce a large air
force. It is possible, however, to produce a limited air force to
fulfill particular roles. Tactical bombers (TAC) and Naval bombers are
very well suited for Italy's theaters of war, and are highly
recommended. Interceptors are not as important, and likely beyond
Italy's limited resources.

If you plan to play a longer game interceptors or fighters are a must
have for Italy, as the Allies will bomb Europe to death from ´41 on if
you are defenceless. Enemy naval bombers in the Med are something you
probably do not want to tolerate (at least in Armageddon they can become
a pain in the a\*\*), so prepare to do something against them.

##  War 

Unlike all other major powers who have very clear adversaries that must
be challenged, Italy does not have any direct opponents. This allows an
Italian player to choose their own path with a great deal of
flexibility. The most essential sphere of warfare for Italy is the
Mediterranean Sea, best managed through Gibraltar in the West and Suez
in the East. Control of the Mediterranean is vital to the defense of
Italy's home shores, and enables Italy free movement throughout Northern
Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. Historically, Africa was
an important theater of war due to Italian holdings in Libya and
Ethiopia, yet involvement in Africa is a questionable strategy in-game.

###  Italo-Ethiopian War 

The game begins with Italy at war with Ethiopia. It is quite easy to
direct Italian units straight to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, and
win the war. With Italian units in the capital, the player has two
choices for resolving the war:

-   Annex Ethiopia outright, and gain two IC, and enough resources to
    support those two IC.
-   Sue for peace with Ethiopia, and demand they become a puppet. This
    avoids dissent caused by annexation and then liberation (DD & ARMA),
    and it also keeps the Ethiopian army intact. This will allow
    Ethiopia to have an army of around 15 divisions by the fall of 1939,
    which can be military controlled by Italy.

If you don't mind the gamey-ness, keeping the war with Ethiopia going
for a while has numerous benefits. Militia on militia action is
excellent training for your commanders, and consumer goods demand will
stay low as long as you're at war. Attack with a few militia divisions,
and add more as the fight progresses and your troops start to get beat
up. A good battle will last a week. You can use your naval bombers on
Interdiction missions to get them valuble experience without doing much
damage to the ethiopians. All in all, you can get your army a decent
experience boost, half a dozen (the good ones) leaders up to skill level
6-7 and another dozen or two a couple levels higher without commiting
more than a few weeks of manpower production - and Italy doesn't have
the IC to use all that manpower anyway.

###  Spanish Civil War 

On July 18, 1936, the Spanish Civil War will occur. Playing as an Axis
nation means the odds are stacked against the Nationalists, who will
likely loose. Italy should always send help, via the in-game event, to
Nationalist Spain to avoid 5 dissent and an isolationist move. Beyond
that event, Italy has three practical choices:

-   Do nothing and let the Nationalists loose.
-   Assist the Nationalists in regaining their country by declaring war
    on Republican Spain at the beginning of the war
-   Wait until the Nationalists have been defeated (between 6 - 18
    months), and invade Republican Spain in order to annex it. An
    annexed Spain will provide 8 IC, 39 energy, 18 rares, and 28 metal.
    This is particularly helpful since Italy is short on all major
    resources. Note that Spain is key to capturing Gibraltar, which is
    imperative for achieving strategic control of the Mediterranean Sea.
    Also note that Spain provides a second front against France when
    Fall Weiss occurs.

###  Albanian Occupation 

At the end of March, 1939 (following the German invasion of
Czechoslovakia) Italy will have the option to give King Zog an ultimatum
regarding annexation. While Albania does not offer significant value, it
provides Italy a foothold in the Balkans, and a staging point for
possible actions in Greece and Yugoslavia. Taking Albania is simple,
since it does not produce troops (DD & ARMA).

###  Early opportunities for war 

Italy has several nonaggression pacts with its neighbors, which
considerably reduce Italy's opportunity for local war mongering. All
these non-aggression pacts, however, will eventually expire:

-   January, 1939: Pact with Turkey expires. An Italy with a high
    belligerence, however, will likely cause a Soviet DOW if Italy
    decides to attack Turkey.
-   March, 1939: Pact with Greece expires. After the annexation of
    Albania at the end of March, Greece is a fairly easy target. Romania
    will likely declare war as a result.
-   June, 1939: Pact with France expires. Italy may find France
    challenging if they are not in the Axis. If Italy is in the Axis,
    and early war with France will spoil the war with Poland.

###  Fall Weiss 

The German invasion of Poland in August 30, 1939 is an important date
for Italy, either as an early warning of the wider war soon to come, or
as the beginning of open conflict with the Allies due to an early join
with the Axis. Italy has several important military objectives:

-   Secure the Mediterranean Sea by taking Gibraltar and Suez.
-   Defend Italian borders with France, possibly lead offensive assaults
    into France.
-   Resolve North Africa strategy: abandon Libya and Egypt or engage in
    a North African campaign

###  Sitzkrieg 

After the invasion of Poland, Europe goes quiet for quite some time.
Italy has a few options during this lull, starting with Yugoslavia.
Italy has claims on Yugoslavian territories. Since Yugoslavia has
several guarantees of independence, an early declaration of war (before
1939) is risky, and could embroil Italy into WWII with the Allies
attacking, or could trigger war from Turkey, Greece, or even Germany.
Therefore, war with Yugoslavia should only occur after Fall Weiss,
and/or after Italy is prepared to go to war with the Allies. Full
annexation of Yugoslavia within three weeks is achievable. With 25 total
IC, Italy will gain 5 base IC in normal conditions, or 9 base IC in the
event that Albini is the Minister of Security.

If Northern Africa has been successfully secured, a campaign against
Southern Africa can be fruitful. No Italian controlled port is within
3000 km of South Africa, and taking Italian troops on ground throughout
the length of Africa could easily take years. Thus, an alternate (quite
challenging) method is to capture the Diego Garcia Island (from Port
Massaua). This port island can take transports within range of Durban.
While South Africa is not heavily guarded (SA has extremely low
manpower), landing will be difficult.

##  Strategy 

Strategically, Italy has two primary objectives:

-   Control the Mediterranean Sea (Gibraltar & Suez).
-   Ensure the Soviet Union is defeated.

An Italy that achieves both objectives can play a significant role in
ensuring the Axis rules the world. If either objective fails, Italy is
almost certainly doomed.

###  Mediterranean Control 

The most important key to a successful Italy is control of the
Mediterranean. The most effective way to control the Mediterranean is
through the capture of Gibraltar and Suez, preventing any new allied
ships from entering the Mediterranean. With that accomplished, the
remaining UK fleet will need to be destroyed, since the French fleet
will disappear with the fall of France by Germany.

In HOI2, the most effective way to destroy the Royal Navy is through
maintaining air superiority over the Mediterranean and making good use
of Naval Bombers. By using Naval Bombers you will slowly whittle down
the Royal Navy and after a series of heavy Port Strikes on Gibraltar,
Malta and the Egyptian coast, the RN may well be grounded and you will
be able to roam freely across the Med.

In DD & ARMA, control of the Mediterranean is more challenging. First, a
Northern African campaign that removes all ports, including those in the
Middle East, will considerably help. Next, waiting for several months as
the Royal Navy runs out of supplies and oil helps greatly amplify
Italy's tiny Naval force. Then, Naval bombers will help soften up the
Royal Naval. Finally, Italy's starting navy can begin to sink the Royal
Navy.

###  European Strategy 

On this path, Italy's warfare focuses almost exclusively on the European
theater, putting little, if any, resources into Africa. This could mean
early war with Spain, Greece, and Yugoslavia. This path also requires
Italian involvement in the war against the Soviet Union, to ensure
Germany wins. This can be accomplished by joining German forces on their
front lines, or by opening up a new front against the Soviet Union. One
way to create a new front is to invade and Annex Turkey, which will
provide Italy direct access to the Baku, oil rich region, in addition
the the Black Sea. This strategy requires emphasis on land and bomber
forces, and will entirely neglect the Navy. Italy's most pressing need
when fighting the Soviet Union will be manpower, due to the sheer size
of the land and number of Soviet divisions. A quick victory is
imperative for the Axis. When manpower has been exhausted, focus on IC
intensive units such as the air force. After the defeat of the Soviet
Union, a Navy should be built.

###  African Strategy 

Most of Africa is an infrastructure nightmare, meaning that troops will
be low on combat efficiency (ESE), TC will be considerably stressed, and
moving troops will be extremely slow: moving from one province to the
next may take months!

Africa has some strategic value:

-   Northern Africa has airbases that the Allies can be use to pester
    your forces.
-   Northern Africa also has ports, and while the Royal Navy may be
    trapped after Italy controls the Mediterranean Sea, they will still
    be in supply, and able to harass the Italian navy.
-   Central and Southern Africa have some good resources, including
    metals and rares.

An effective Africa strategy can be conducted with the following steps:

-   Ensure Ethiopia is a puppet, and take military control of their
    armies. Use their armies to grab as much land in Africa as possible.
-   Limit Italian military involvement.
-   Use Infantry and Militia, don´t use MOT, MEC, ARM in the central
    African jungles and never use CAV in Africa.
-   For Central Africa, use Marines if possible; for Southern Africa,
    use Mountaineers.

###  Fortress Italy 

In this strategy, Italy essentially ignores the rest of the world,
refuses to join the Axis or the Allies, and simply fortifies its home
lands. This means abandoning Libya for pragmatic reasons.

Securing Italy's beaches is a relatively easy task, although it will
require a fair amount of time and effort. Italy has a large number of
beaches, which can be quite strongly secured with a three unit stack of:
(a) infantry division plus artillery; (b) militia; (c) militia. Make a
note of the "crossroads" provinces, ones that border 3 beach provinces.
Perugia and Potenza are best. These are the provinces for Italy to store
reaction forces: Armoured, motorized, mechanized, calvary, etc. With
their speed, use them to rapidly reinforce beach defenders using the
"support defense" mission. A Navy is not important since beaches can be
more efficiently defended, and no Italian Navy could match the Royal
Navy or the USN.

The most vulnerable location for Italy are its land borders. Eventually,
the Soviet Union and the Allies will be on those borders, and they may
declare war. Therefore, land forts are a necessity along Italy's
Northern borders, combined with a strong emphasis on Interceptors.

###  Italy the Traitor 

Italy can join the Allies! Most players would consider this gamey, just
as attacking Germany or the USA in 1936, for example, is gamey. In any
event, an Italy that joins the Allies, especially in the fall of 1941
when Germany has all forces on the Eastern front, can score an easy
victory for Italy.

###  Roman Strategy 

It is possible to get a 20th century Roman Empire. No doubt this is very
gamey and ahistorical, but given Italy's numerous handicaps it is also
quite a feat to accomplish. At the start of the game, make peace with
Ethiopia and forget about them and Somalia for the rest of the game.
Your troops will be spread thin enough as it is whithout defending their
useless deserts. Start building two factories, and allocate the rest of
your IC to reinforcements and upgrades while you shuttle your troops
back from Ethiopia. You'll want to build around 10 factories as early as
possible - that'll give you the 5th research slot when you annex Spain.
Don't cancel the light cruiser that starts in your production queue, it
is only 16 days from completion. Change your ministers to maximize IC
and manpower bonuses. You will not join the Axis, as it would be a
disgrace for the noble Romans to seek any sort of agreement with the
Germanic barbarians. Merely sharing common enemies with them will be
enough.

Ressearch will be focused on industrial techs at first. The cryptography
techs are a must, even if they take forever to ressearch thanks to your
bad tech teams. You also want the 1936 manpower techs as early as
possible. You want to get to the small arms assembly line ASAP, and that
means non-stop ressearch in this field. For your military you will need
infantry, mountaineers, militia and cavalry. You'll never have enough TC
to support large motorized formations so you might as well not try.
Artillery will also be useful (and possibly SP-Art for your cav divs) to
augment the strength of your relatively small armies.

Once these essential techs are ressearched far enough down the tree you
can do Interceptors and Tac bombers, along with some air and naval
doctrines. Just keep in mind that no matter how much effort you put into
these, you'll always be a step behind your main opponents. Do not
abandon your land doctrine. The infiltration assault path is perfectly
suited to the forces you are going to field. Anyways you won't ally with
Germany so it won't be possible to get all the blueprints for the
spearhead doctrine. The diplomacy sliders should be moved to full hawk
first, and then begin to move to full standing army. After that it
doesn't matter that much since you'll either have won or lost the game.
It will pay off to set the sliders to generate extra money and engage
heavily in intelligence activities (to steal blueprints).

Your army should be organized into army corps of Mil/Inf/Inf. Militia is
key as it bolsters your ranks significantly and you only have so much
manpower to spare. Your navy is obsolete but some of it will be useful
in shore bombardment duties. Assemble an 18 ship SAG with your 4 BBI's
and 5 CAIII's, plus your 9 best screens. Then put some sort of a
transport fleet together with the CAII'S and CLII's as protection, and
disband anything that's left over. Submarines can be kept as they can be
useful as pickets. Keep your starting air force, as it will be a long
time before you can spare the IC to build more.

After your troops are reinforced and upgraded to 1936 infantry, you're
ready to invade and annex Spain. This will open up a second front
against France - which you will need. Once Spain is yours, you must
build up your army as much as possible before the outbreak of WWII. Send
some spies into France and build at least as many infantry divisions as
they will (you can count your militia as an infantry div. for that
purpose).

Guarantee the independence of germany so that when France and the UK
declare war on them, you can DOW them without suffering dissent. When
the war breaks out, you must beat Germany into France and deny them any
conquests there. It really is a race against the clock, because you
essentially need to wrap up the war before winter or the German
blitzkrieg in the spring of 1940 will deny northern France to the
greatness of Rome. Conquering France can be difficult, as they are
likely to have a doctrine and cryptography lead on you. In fact the war
with France is the most likely point where this strategy will break
down. To secure victory you will most certainly need to have an
excellent grasp of the combat mechanics and use every advantage you can.
Since you're not allied with the german barbarians, Vichy France will
not trigger and you'll get to keep it all.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you can find the spare cash to
influence them you might be able to bribe the Axis minors into allying
with you instead of Germany. This will really turn the tide against
Hitler and when the time comes you'll be glad to have them with you
instead of against you.

Don't forget to leave some troops in Africa to push the brits back to
Suez and also a few divs in Spain to quickly seize Gibraltar. A goal of
sealing off the Mediterranean before the new year is reasonable. Once
France has fallen, redeploy your troops to Venice and launch an
offensive into the Balkans. Again you need to do this before the germans
have a chance to try so don't wait any longer than you need. You want to
annex Yugoslavia and Greece. If you've gotten to this point, all there
is left is Turkey and every province bordering the Med will be green.
However you should probably wait until Germany is at war with the Soviet
Union before declaring war upon the Turks. Since you'll have sky-high
beligerence by then, your DOW might trigger them into attacking you.
Common sense dictates that a war against both of these behemoths could
only end badly for Rome. If they do declare war, at least they'll also
be fighting each other so the situation will be a little more
manageable.

Now assuming that you avoided war with Germany and the SU, there is one
last nut to crack: Londinium. Before you can safely try this you need to
modernize your navy and build a sufficiently strong surface fleet to
support the landing, which will likely take years. Look up the German
strategy page if you need to know more about invading England. So
essentially you're left with a lot of time to kill and a huge empire to
pacify so you'll likely need to build lots of garrison divs. You may
want to try to take France's overseas territories (so you can annex
them) and keep your military on guard in Africa and the Middle-East as a
British offensive from Iraq is not completely out of the question. In
fact taking Iraq would be a good thing to do to occupy your time as your
new navy is being built. Speaking of which - a 30 ship SAG of 13 CA'S, 2
CVL's and 15 DD's (all 1941 models) should be up to the task. If you're
lucky you'll have captured some transports from the french ports, but
most likely you'll need to build some of those as well.

After England has fallen you will have most of the land that was
historically comprised in the Roman Empire. At this point, depending on
the strategic situation in Europe, you might want to try to take on
Germany. If they're losing on the eastern front (which they most likely
will, considering you have denied them almost everything else), it might
be possible to blitz into their industrial heartland and cripple them
significantly before they have a chance to bring reaction forces back
from the East.

There is also the possibility that your conquests confuse the German AI
enough that it will never attack the soviets. In that case you need to
keep in mind that you will face 150+ divs and that the germans will have
a huge doctrine advantage on you until you ressearch the 'infiltration
in depth' tech. Assuming everything has gone as planned your army is
probably around 100 div strong at this point, so a considerable
expansion will be required. Another problem arises from the fact that
your army is almost entirely soft and that you have nothing to counter
the german armor effectively. Building armor is not an option because TC
is already way too overloaded, so the best bet is probably to build some
of the otherwise useless AT brigades for your infantry. This will give
your army some punch against the panzer divs without adding more TC
load. Moreover, infantry divs brigaded with AT will retain full benefits
from the infiltration doctrine while armor would not.

Alternatively, although this is beyond gamey, you can edit a saved game
and add all your new conquests as national territories (simulating a
unified Roman Empire). This will bump your IC into the 300's, quell all
dissent, and turn your TC back to a 'green' figure (and you probably
haven't seen that since 1938). Now you can safely take on Germany and
the SU. At the same time.

Addendum : After some testing, the general strategy was shown to work.
In the test game the war with France was nearly disastrous but succeeded
in the end. Turkey can be attacked/annexed before 1941 and Germany had
almost defeated the Soviet Union when I attacked - and successfuly
defeated - it.
