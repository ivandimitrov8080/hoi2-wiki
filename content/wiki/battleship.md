The Battleship is the Queen of the Sea. It is a massive floating gun
platform, designed primarily to engage enemy capital ships at long range
and send them to the bottom of the ocean. However, they are now
vulnerable to air or submarine torpedo attacks, and the advent of the
Aircraft Carrier has started to number their days.
