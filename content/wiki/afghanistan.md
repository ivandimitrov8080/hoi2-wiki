##  General tips 

1.  Defeat your weak enemies in 1936, before they can build up their
    armies.
2.  Best doctrines for Afghanistan are Mobility Focus/Human Wave, or
    Firepower Focus/Grand Battle Plan.
3.  Build only infantry and cavalry.
4.  Don't join the Axis. This will lead you to a two front war.

##  Preview 

As you see, Afghanistan is not a very powerful nation. On the contrary,
it's between two of the world's greatest nations. But there are a few
good things. You have 7 divisions, one of them is normal infantry and
another is cavalry. Their strength is low, but that's not a problem.
Just reinforce them to 100 strength and you have the most powerful army
in central Asia. You don't have many resources, but you get enough
resources from your motherland. You have surpluses of energy and you can
trade it away for supplies. Your state may be isolated by major powers,
but I've played HoI2 over one year, and the AI has never attacked
Afghanistan. But most things make your game hard. Your slides suck, but
it's not a problem, because you never have to hurry playing Afghanistan.
Your government's isolationism makes it a bit difficult to declare wars,
because your dissent skyrockets in every DoW. Your ministers are also
very bad: *[Muhammed
Zahir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Zahir_Shah)* is an
*autocratic charmer* , which means -10% IC.

##  Before war 

Preparing your nation for war!

###  Policies 

Your government is extremely bad. Head of state removes -10% IC,
security -3% IC and other ministers are useless in war policies. Your
sliders also aren't very good for warmaking, because your lobby is
almost full dove, and you have zero interventionism. First start moving
isolationism-slider towards interventionism. You don't have any
ministers you can change to in 1936, but over the next few years you get
a few more ministers, and there are some good ones too. Change your
minister of security to Carlo Garbasso (prince of terror). He is
available in 1938. Always select ministers who increase your IC. You
don't care about influencing. You need no friends. Actually, if you join
to some alliance this will make you a satellite and your game will be
nothing except boring waiting - or it can doom you.

###  Research and build 

You have only one tech team, and it's really bad. Skill level is 1 and
components for Human Wave or Grand Battle Plan doctrine. Start
researching manufacturing. You have so much manpower that you don't need
to take care about it yet. After these research doctrines, go for
infantry and cavalry. Also, researching artillery is a good idea.
Another good doctrine is Human Wave. It gives high morale, but
synchronize publication of Human Wave to peace time, because it lowers
your organization -10.

You have to build 'normal' infantry units, which forms the core of your
armies. Militias are also good, because you have so little IC. Build and
use cavalry as quick-movement troops, that you can use to encircle
enemies, break frontlines etc. But remember, that Afghanistan lacks the
IC to fight Blitzkrieg. Put your artillery on militia units, that makes
them more powerful.

##  First expansions 

###  Persia 

In 1936, you have these seven divisions. Your neigbours, Sinkiang and
Persia, have 3 and 2 divisions. Move all your armies to Afghani-Persian
border and same time reinforce all your divisions to 100 strength. Also,
build money and when you have enough money, cancel non-agression pact
and declare war. USSR and UK have guaranteed Persia, but normally they
don't declare war. If they now declare war, start new game. Put your
cavalry in one unit and other divisions to 3 divisions corps. Your
cavalry can now quickly storm in southern Persia and take southern and
western victory points. Infantry will assault to west, capture victory
points and then defeat weak Persian forces what are moving to battle.
Their organization is low after marching and you probably have 1:6
superiority. Don't fight frontline war in Persia, just take victory
points and annex.

###  Sinkiang 

After annexing Persia turn around and move all your troops to Sinkiang
border. Your dissent is pretty high after declaration of war, so try low
it building consumer goods. Don't wait that all your dissent has gone,
because this time Sinkiang build divisions and defeating them will be
harder. Declare war when all your divisions are 100 strength and ready
to attack. Sinkiang has not very big army and you only can push your
forces to Urumqi. Then annex.

###    Whats next? 

You now have have about 10 IC, but you can use only portion of it. Now
you have years of time to build up. Build enough consumer goods that
your dissent is again zero. You can try to conquer Tibet and Yunnan
clique (before Yunnan joins to Chinese united front). Build new
divisions and prepare for war...

##  Against Soviet Union 

Germans DoW USSR in 1941. Wait that they conquer all big cities, like
Leningrad, Stalingrad, Moscow, Kiev etc. Wait that Red army is almost
destroyed and Germans attacking over Ural and Caucasus. Then declare
war, right year would be some 1943. If you can take Baku oilfields, it's
great thing, but declaring war so early will almost surely condemn you
to die. But in Central Asia there's enough to conquer anyway. From
Sinkiang you can push on Soviet satellites in Far East.
