##    **The East is Red -- Goering's Delay** 

*The East is Red -- Goering's Delay is an evolution of a long term
multiplayer HOI II modding endeavour started in 2007. Aimed at creating
a flexible and balanced multiplayer experience in HOI2 DD Armageddon the
system was originally designed solely for multiplayer gaming it has now
been upgraded with AI enhancements so that it will play out in single
player mode.*

**The Balance of Power and Floating Historical Events:**

In HOI II one can pretty much depend on certain things happening at a
certain time in the game. One knows that Germany is 99% likely to invade
Poland in late August 1939, that Anschluss will happen in March 1939,
that Munich will happen in the fall of 1938 and the Czech Republic will
fall in the Spring of 1939. Good enough, but this is also predictable,
and allows players to make set build orders defined by simple
strategies. If players step beyond the scripted events, the historical
event train is lost. In the East is Red -- Goeringâ€™s Delay almost all of
the important historical events are tied into the balance of military
power between Germany and the Allies. So while players options in the
run up to the war are limited by the Treaty of Versailles and
non-aggression pacts between the worlds major powers the arms race is
on, and nothing can be predicted. German ability to annex Austria, and
force Czech compliance to its demand for the Sudetenland is dependent on
having equal or superior military land forces at its disposal.

The Austrians and the Czechs are not just going to give in because
Hitler says so. Once Germany has military parity or better with the
Allies the historical events will begin to fire and the Treaty of
Versaille will end. Anschluss will surely fire sometime after January
1938, and sometime after that Germany will be able to end the Treaty of
Versailles, removing its Non-Aggression Pacts with the most of the
European countries. From that point on Germany has many options. It can
immediately invade Czech, or seek to make it fall by making territorial
demands. Germany could even seek to bring Czechoslovakia into its
alliance if the government is compatible. It could even ignore
Czechoslovakia entirely and go straight for Poland, or even hope to keep
Poland temporarily out of the war, and strike west immediately for
Belgium and try to catch the French unprepared, and snap up Denmark on
the way.

In short Germany gets to decide when and how WWII will begin, *without
losing the main lines of the historical event train* .
