##  Basics 

###    What is an exported game? 

An "exported game" is a finished Victoria:Revolutions game that has been
converted into a Hearts of Iron II one. It begins where the Victoria
game ended; the started date is always January 1st, 1936 unless the file
has been manually edited by the user.

###    How do I export a game (from Victoria to HoI2)? 

Once you finish your Vicky game, you will see that there's an "export"
option at the end game pop-up (not the screen after that). Click on that
button and proceed to save the game. Then, go to your exported games
folder (scenarios -\> save games). Each exported file will begin with
the name of the nation you were playing with when the game ended, along
with HoI2 start date (01/01/1936). Copy the desired file and paste it in
your Hearts of Iron II save games folder.

###    Will the exported game look the same as it did on Victoria? 

Naturally, no. Because Hearts of Iron uses very different units,
settings, province positioning (and so on) then many conversions will
take place. Outlining the differences is what this article will mostly
focus on. Knowing them beforehand can make your life much more tranquil
when you decide to carry on that Victoria game within the realms of
Hearts of Iron II.

  

##    Changes, conversions, differences and so on 

###  Provincial Division 

Because Hearts of Iron's provinces are divided differently than those in
Victoria, your borders may look slightly different in HoI2. Some
provinces are larger, others are smaller, and a few are inexistent in a
game or the other. Per instance, if A owns province X and B owns
province Y and Z; and XYZ is one sole province in HoI2, then B will
control it completely. Or, if B owns K, and in HoI2 K is divided into L,
M and N, B will have control over them all.

Claimed territories (with a colonial building) will go to whoever
claimed it during the Victoria game.

You can check the exact information about provincial conversion from
Vicky to HoI2 in the "vic2hoiprovince.csv" file, located in Victoria's
database folder. Each line in the file will contain the following
information:

    Victoria Province ID;HoI2 Province ID

  

###  Countries 

Because some countries present in Victoria do not exist in Hearts of
Iron and vice-versa, those are converted into other nations present in
HoI2. At times, more than a Vicky nation will be converted into the same
Hearts of Iron nation (as it happens with the minor Indian states, all
of them become India). At other times, a nation will emerge as another
(e.g. Tripoli in Vicky turns into Libya).

Custom made nations will not appear in the exported game (an error may
bar one from loading the game). The user must modify vic2hoicountry.csv
at Victoria's database folder in order to add a proper country
conversion. The same folder may be modified as well to alter other
countries' conversions. Each line in the file will contain the following
information:

    Victoria Country Tag;HoI2 Country Tag; Victoria Country Name; HoI2 Country Name;x

###  Technology 

Doctrines in HoI2 correspond to inventions in Victoria. See [Army
Inventions](/index.php?title=Army_Inventions&action=edit&redlink=1 "Army Inventions (page does not exist)")
and [Navy
Inventions](/index.php?title=Navy_Inventions&action=edit&redlink=1 "Navy Inventions (page does not exist)")
.

###  Units 

[forum thread on unit
conversions](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?406223-What-does-a-engineers-brigade-convert-to-in-Hearts-of-Iron)

-   Infantry divisions remain Infantry divisions while it's brigades
    convert as follows:
    -   Artillery and Engineer Brigades remain Artillery and Engineer
        Attachments.
    -   Regulars brigades become a Military Police attachment.
    -   Guard Brigades become an Armored Car attachment.
    -   "barrel" attachments become Light Tank divisions.
    -   Fighter attachments become Interceptors
    -   Bomber attachments become Tactical Bombers
    -   an Infantry division with the HQ brigade will trasform into an
        HQ unit. this is the one case where the Infantry division does
        not become a seperete unit.

&nbsp;

-   Cavalry divisions remain Cavalry, attached brigades are simply
    deleted.
-   Dragoons, bizarrely, turn into '36 Mountain Divisions!

Note: Infantry and cavalry are converted to the '18 Infantry and '18
cavalry,respectively, unless the own has researched "Modern divisional
structure" which makes them the more advanced '36 versions

-   Air bases appear in Provinces where planes initially stationed,
    possibly also in areas of high infrastructure? (more investigation
    required)
-   Forts and naval bases mostly carry over but interact strangely with
    areas where multiple provinces were merged together in the
    conversion.
-   dreadnoughts, battleships, cruisers, and carriers are converted to
    their namesake units in HOI2
-   Steam transports are converted to Transports
-   Minelayer, Minesweeper, and Destroyer Flotilla attachements all
    convert into Destroyers
-   all other naval units are discarded.
-   province Infrastructure is determined by the province rail level.
-   a nation's Industry rating determines their total starting
    Industrial Capacity, which is then distributed among their provinces
    by a formula in which relative population of the province and and
    number of factories in the state are known to be factors.
-   HOI2 Government type is determined by Vicky Government type and
    Party in power.
-   Other position sliders are determined by factors not yet known to
    this writer.
-   A nations Tech Teams are generated semi-randomly, apparently being
    specialized economically is supposed to give you Tech Teams better
    suited to certain research (more tank factories give tech teams more
    suited to tank design, more officers better for doctrine research,
    etc.) then named after the tech teams in the HOI2 base campaign From
    the same country and with similar specialties.
