##    Are you seriously playing Ethiopia? 

Well, here are some tips:

1.  Make some [militias](/Militia "Militia") and armored cars; they're
    the only things you can bother making. But don't make too many!
    You'll need the IC so you can...
2.  Oversupply your attacking forces as much as you can without
    exceeding TC or running out of supplies.
3.  Research 1936 infantry. You won't be making infantry divisions, but
    upgrading the Imperial Bodyguard is useful.
4.  Research Human Wave land doctrine.
5.  War Hawks and Standing Army are nice as far as sliders go.
6.  Surround and eliminate Italian forces whenever the opportunity
    arises.
7.  Outnumber the Italians in every battle, especially when attacking.
8.  Reinforce the Imperial Bodyguard and use them for offense whenever
    you can. Its attack-to-defense ratio is far higher than that of
    militia divisions.

##  Step 1: Pull back 

Start off by pulling your forces into a better defensive position. Just
don't retreat too far..."too far" being when you have less than two
provinces. If the Italians surround your capital, you're screwed.

##  Step 2: Counterattack South 

While holding onto the northern border, push south. With any luck you'll
surround and destroy the Italians in Somalia.

As soon as you take a coastline province, start trading supplies for
whatever raw material you need with the Brits. For some reason they
cancel trade deals if you don't have a coast province. I'm not sure if
this varies between game versions or mods or what.

Occupying these provinces will kill your TC, so liberate the nation
Somalia as soon as you've removed all Italian territory. Somalia will
have absolutely no resources or manpower or IC or anything. The only
drawback to liberation is that you lose sea access, and by extension,
British trade. But hey, it was nice while it lasted.

##  TO BE CONTINUED 

At this point they're still on your north end. Fortunately the only
resource up there is one manpower point in Dese. Whoopty-doo.

Should you try a northern offensive? Should you just hold on and hope
Italy gets wrapped up in other business? I don't know yet.

Good luck!
