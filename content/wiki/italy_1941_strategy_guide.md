One of my favorite scenarios as it starts you off as set piece almost.

You can defeat the
[British](/index.php?title=British&action=edit&redlink=1 "British (page does not exist)")
in [Africa](/Africa "Africa") - you just need speed and a sense of
urgency (building an
[airforce](/index.php?title=Airforce&action=edit&redlink=1 "Airforce (page does not exist)")
is good but long term, you need to defeat the British with what you
have.)

I - Destroy the British pocket behind your lines and consolidate your
forces in Africa into two provinces facing the British (keep a division
or two back to garrison your major port/airfield provinces.

II - Reorganize your airforce and have focus it on the African front,
with your [Fighters](/Fighters "Fighters") covering, your
[bombers](/index.php?title=Bombers&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bombers (page does not exist)")
interdicting, and your
[Naval](/index.php?title=Naval&action=edit&redlink=1 "Naval (page does not exist)")
regiments patroling/bombing the seas around Sicily (to look for British
fleets).

III - Strategically deploy/march as much of your Army on the continent
as possible to
[Taranto](/index.php?title=Taranto&action=edit&redlink=1 "Taranto (page does not exist)")
, keeping forces only to garrison beaches until they can be replaced by
[Garrison](/Garrison "Garrison") / [Militia](/Militia "Militia") corps
properly

IV - Form your Navy into two branchesÂ : one large Fleet of Surface Ships
and Transports, and secondly some smaller fleets of
[Submarines](/index.php?title=Submarines&action=edit&redlink=1 "Submarines (page does not exist)")
. The Submarines you can use not for convoy but as pickets around the
Med to trip up and trigger combat with enemy navies to find out their
location.

V- The Surface Fleet you use ONLY to load up Army Divisions and the Sea
Transport mission to the closest port possible in Africa, as fast as
possible. You may even want to leave your old [BB](/BB "BB") -Is behind
to gain the 3kph of speed. Keep Sea Transporting forces to Africa as
possible. If you get into combat with a large RN Battle Fleet then
retreat and try again later.

VI- The bulk of your army and air force should now be in Africa,
frontally assault the enemy (which you should by now outnumber) and send
him reeling back across the middle east, use your Bombers (now) to
Ground attack his formations.

VII - With
[Suez](/index.php?title=Suez&action=edit&redlink=1 "Suez (page does not exist)")
secure you can hold a line in Southern Egypt of 2/3 provinces and push
into [Iraq](/Iraq "Iraq") for it's oil, or you can amphibious operations
against Allied Islands in the Med (or both).
[Gibraltar](/index.php?title=Gibraltar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gibraltar (page does not exist)")
is nearly impossible without Spain so your options there are limited.

-You don't have the [IC](/IC "IC") to use [Offensive
supply](/index.php?title=Offensive_supply&action=edit&redlink=1 "Offensive supply (page does not exist)")

-As for builds, I'd concentrate on [Tactical
Bombers](/Tactical_Bombers "Tactical Bombers") /
[Escorts](/index.php?title=Escorts&action=edit&redlink=1 "Escorts (page does not exist)")
to destroy enemy forces as they move in [Africa](/Africa "Africa") /
[Middle
East](/index.php?title=Middle_East&action=edit&redlink=1 "Middle East (page does not exist)")
; infantry divsions, and garrisons.

You can lay down some Cruisers/DDs/Submarines and Naval aviation
regiments. You can destroy isolated enemy transports and small fleets by
using a fast fleet of Italy's Cruisers/Destroyers to engage in combat,
kill, and then retreat before any large Battleship/Carrier fleet.

VIII - With a line held in
[Egypt](/index.php?title=Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1 "Egypt (page does not exist)")
, the Middle East Secure - you should have some time to build up before
the US or British can again field a strong force in the area,,so you can
send air support to [Germany](/Germany "Germany") ,,etc.
