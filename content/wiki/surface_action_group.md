###    Surface Action Group (SAG) 

The **Surface Action Group** is quite different to the [Carrier Task
Force](/Carrier_Task_Force "Carrier Task Force") (CTF). The SAG relies
on killing its enemy, rather than driving it from the area. A SAG is a
task force of surface ships whose primary duty is to attack and sink
other surface ships. It relies on *Gun Ships* to do direct damage to the
Strength of other ships. A SAG also excels in its secondary duty of
providing Shore Bombardment support to friendly land units fighting in
coastal areas.

####  Fleet Composition 

Considering a fleet composition of 18 ships, the strongest SAG is as
follows. This model can be followed with less powerful SAGs, by
replacing the SHBBs with BBs for a still potent force. Using BBs is more
cost effective, since 3 BBs can be built for every 2 SHBBs. Finally,
Heavy Cruisers (CA) can be used, for a cheap, yet still reasonably
strong SAG.

-   6 [Super Heavy Battleships](/Battleship "Battleship") (SHBB) (or
    normal Battleships)
-   2 [Light Carriers](/Escort_Carrier "Escort Carrier") (CVL)
-   10 [Destroyers](/Destroyer "Destroyer") (DD)

####  Zerg Fleets 

Zerg fleets are considered a [gamey](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics")
exploit of the flawed naval combat engine. This exploit was tested and
made popular by [Blue
Emu](/index.php?title=User:Blue_Emu&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Blue Emu (page does not exist)")
, and features a fleet that uses a single [Combat
Range](/Combat_Range "Combat Range") as a way of ensuring as many guns
as possible are brought to bear on the opposing fleet. Zerg fleets are
based on the simple fact that the naval model means that the more ships
in combat, the more damage can be done. The Zerg fleet is feasible only
if it can close in on its preferred range. Before the Armageddon 1.3beta
patch, this was possible due to the amazing strength of the light
carriers which ensure closing to within range of the shortest range
capital vessel in the fleet. With the Armageddon 1.3beta patch, CVLs
still help in closing the range, but no longer magically do so. Having
up-to-date doctrines and good leadership and positioning is now
impervious for a zerg fleet. Zerg fleets have two basic forms. The
original form is less gamey, while the DD zerg is widely considered an
exploit.

#####  The Original Cruizerg Fleet 

-   5 (1938) Heavy Cruisers (CA)
-   2 Light Carriers (CVL)
-   11 (1938) Light Cruisers with fire control (CL-FC)

For a total of 18 Ships.

This Cruizerg is effective because the light cruiser screen vessels,
when equipped with fire control, have the exact same firing range as the
heavy cruisers. A typical BB SAG would have only the Battleships in
firing range, while all other naval vessels would simply absorb damage
but not otherwise participate in the battle. Thus, when the Cruizerg
meets a BB SAG, the Cruizerg is actually more powerful, not to mention
[twice as efficient in IC
cost](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showpost.php?p=9092898&postcount=9)
.

#####  DD Zerg Fleet 

A zerg fleet based on destroyers is an example of hopelessly [gamey
tactics](/Gamey_tactics "Gamey tactics") , but is certainly an effective
killing machine. Usually, plain DD-fleets can close in to 5km range by
the second hour of battle.

-   60 - 90 DD

#####  Cruizerg Fleets for Doomsday 

Doomsday lacks naval brigades, so one has to use obsolete vessels to
make the strategy work. There are two setups, one involving either all
CA-IIs and CL-IVs or a mix of CA-IIs and CA-IIIs, the second consisting
of all CA-IIIs and CL-VIs. Note that at least one of the CAs needs to be
of one level *lower* than the CLs, so that their range is identical.
CVLs are necessary as well, to ensure the fleet will close with CTFs. In
Doomsday, CVLs can still magically close the combat range to their
preferred range. This was rectified with the Armageddon 1.3beta patch.

######  Early-Game Composition 

-   2 CA-II (Absolutely necessary for the strategy to work to allow
    CL-IV to be in range since the CVL will go to the lowest ranged
    capital ship)
-   4 CA-III (CA-II will work here as well)
-   2 CVL
-   10 CL-IV

######  Late-Game Composition 

-   6 CA-III
-   2 CVL
-   10 CL-VI

####  Hybrid Fleet Composition 

If you want something with the shore bombardment power of the SAG and
battle prowess superior to the the cruizerg, look no further. I've taken
down other human players using cruizerg fleets with this, but it can
still be taken down by destroyer zerg fleets.

-   4 BB-VII-FX (SHBB)
-   2 BB-III (no FX, important\*)
-   2 CVL
-   10 CL-IV-FC(2)

'\* BB-III and CL-IV-FC (with an upgraded FC) both have a range of 34,
if you put a FX on the BB-III's, the light cruisers will not be able to
fire on the enemy. This is not an issue when putting FC's on the SHBB's
since they will be firing as soon as they are in range and pack a much
bigger punch.

For later naval warfare:

-   4 BB-IX-FX (SHBB2)
-   2 BB)IV (no FX, same reason as above)
-   2 CVL
-   10 CL-VI-FC(2)

The engagement range here is 36 and has better firepower.
