###  [Escort Fighters](/Escort_Fighters "Escort Fighters") 

Escort Fighters are long-range fighters, designed to escort bombers and
keep enemy interceptors from the bombers. They are drilled in tactics to
achieve this mission and receive a bonus when escorting bombers. In Air
Superiority missions, they are less effective.

    A major change in HOI2:DD is that [[Escort fighters]] are brigade type units attached to bombers.
    This results in better values for the bomber when intercepted by enemy planes, but also a lower range.
