If you're playing with a mod such as Historical Stony Road (which I
personally recommend), you will experience a slightly different and much
more challenging gameplay as Nationalist China. Although the idea
remains the same - building loads of infantry units and trying to
upgrade most divisions to 1936 before Japs attack, you will also need to
think and act quick about warlords that surround you.

Here are basic steps and warnings on how to play:

1.  Move most forces to the South and take Guanxi and Yunnan as soon as
    possible, try to just rush them with your huge forces. If you do it
    quick, you might have time to take Communist China as well. This is
    a bit trickier and requires you to surround their province one by
    one. The last province (the one with all the IC in it) will give you
    hell and will most likely hold for very long, so generally speaking,
    I wouldn't recommend attacking Com CHI until later on.
2.  Move most of your forces to the North and declare on Sinkiang, take
    them fast and annex. If Japan declares on you while you're still
    fighting, you might end up losing some provinces, but try to take
    the ones with most IC.
3.  When Japan declares, they will most likely whoop your forces to
    shred if you're not careful. Try to hold major provinces and if
    needed, retreat to your old provinces behind the Yellow river,
    holding each with at least 9 divisions. When winter starts, you
    should be fine since most of them will be frozen and Japs won't be
    able to cross the river, but don't try to attack them either or al
    hell will break lose.
4.  Build, build, build your infantry divisions while researching land
    doctrines with Von Faklenhauser. The other research slots should be
    used for industry stuff.
5.  Hold Jap advance as long as you can and when you have made enough
    divisions for a counter attack, push them back to Manchuria.
6.  Around April 1939 or no later than 1940 you should send or deploy
    about 9-12 divisions in the south, covering the border with French
    Vietnam. I made a mistake of not putting anything there and after
    Vichy France, Japan gets all those provinces and pretty much rushes
    into your major IC center in Yunnan, taking everything in their
    path. So don't make the mistake I did.
7.  Always cover every beach landing with at least 2 units. If you
    don't, japs will land and create another front quickly. Their units
    are more mobile than yours, so you won't even catch up with them.
8.  When South is secure and North is advancing toward Manchuria, you
    might think about starting to research some naval doctrines.
9.  You won't catch up with japs in their doctrines, but you sure could
    try.
10. Remember, Carriers are the key to success, but take time to build.
    Building Super Heavy Battleships will guarantee your triumph over
    anything but carriers and are accessible early in the game, but take
    a lot IC to build. Don't bother with subs since in HSR they're only
    used as convoy destroyers and well you won't be needing that. If you
    like to take chance, you can build 50 or so transporters and try to
    invade mainland Japan using just them without defence. It's quite
    possible if USA DOWed Japan or if Japan is busy fighting UK
    somewhere else. Their fleet will be absent and you might land 20-30
    units before Japan annihilated your TP fleet. If you do decide to
    land, remember to use marine divisions or the stacking penalty will
    negate every attack power you have (i.e. don't land with 50
    divisions at once, stacking penalty will be -99.9 to attack and
    you'll just end up wasting time, attack with 3 marines instead).
11. If Japan surrenders/you manage to annex them. You can get back to
    solving the internal problems - i.e. taking Com CHI and the rest.
    It's possible that by that time the events have turned your nations
    into democracy and you might not be able to DOW anyone, in which
    case you have officially created a very successful Nationalist China
    state and should be proud of yourself:)
12. With Japan gone, your potentials are limitless, USSR is there for
    grabs, but England with its Indian abbundance is probably easier and
    quicker to take.
13. Good luck, commander!
