IC days is a formula for accurately determining the total cost of unit
production. This formula provides data required in order to make long
term production planning decisions.

    IC cost * build time = IC days

For example, 1936 Infantry (assuming no slider bonuses) costs 7 IC to
produce, and will require 95 days to complete. Stated another way, this
means those 7 IC are being exclusively used for a period of 95 days.
Thus, the *real* IC cost for the 1936 Infantry division is actually
(7\*95) 665 total IC.
