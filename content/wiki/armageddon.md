    only half resources)
-   Democracies can now declare war

##  Abyss and Armageddon Explained 

Both these scenarios are in a fantasy setting of which each of the 18
countries have a base IC of 200, although various modifiers change from
country to country, all have similar IC except for the 19th country,
Tannu Tavu which is put in for a hefty challenge for anyone willing. In
terms of ministers and tech teams, and AI, it seems to revolve around
the respective countries in normal HoI. For instance Prussia has
predominantly German ministers tech teams and AI. It is worth assuming
that this scenario was made for a balanced fun multiplayer games.

Although both scenarios are very similar, they are different in that
Abyss starts with all countries at peace and in no sort of alliance
while Armageddon throws the players into an all out brawl between 3
ideological alliances. Here are the alliances :

**Axis - Nationalist Socialist**

-   Empire of Russia
-   Indian Republic
-   Indo China
-   Prussia
-   Confederates
-   The Ottomans

**Allies - Market Liberal**

-   Australasia
-   Bourbon
-   Republic of China
-   Sweden
-   Cossacks
-   USNA

**Comintern - Stalinist**

-   APR (African People's Republic)
-   European Soviets
-   PRRS (People's Republic of the Rising Sun)
-   Republic of Persia
-   Roma
-   Libertadores (South America)
