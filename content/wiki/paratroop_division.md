title: "Paratroop_division"
---

Paratroopers are an elite branch of the Infantry, specifically trained
to either parachute to the ground or be ferried to a battle in gliders.
Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile
reserve or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines.
However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their
mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move
other units to their support.

##  Paratroop Division Statistics 

[TABLE]

##  Brigades allowed 

-   [Anti-aircraft
    Brigade](/Anti-aircraft_Brigade "Anti-aircraft Brigade")
-   [Anti-Tank Brigade](/Anti-Tank_Brigade "Anti-Tank Brigade")
-   [Artillery Brigade](/Artillery_Brigade "Artillery Brigade")

##  Notes 

-   Paratroop divisions are considered a soft unit.
-   Paratroopers have higher org and morale, reduced soft and hard
    attack values, and cost more IC and more manpower compared to a
    normal infantry of the same year.

Paratroopers are much maligned by veteran players for several reasons:

-   They require players to pursue two research trees (paratroopers and
    transport planes)
-   Transport planes are extremely expensive in [IC
    days](/IC_days "IC days")
-   Transport planes have very limited range
-   Paratroopers are average at combat

|               |             |               |          |      |           |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|----------|------|-----------|
| Unit          | Soft Attack | Defensiveness | Manpower | Cost | BuildTime |
| Airborne 1939 | 8           | 11            | 15       | 12   | 210       |
| Infantry 1939 | 12          | 18            | 10       | 7    | 95        |

This means that the Airborne unit requires 2,520 IC days versus 665 IC
days for Infantry, in exchange for considerably lower combat ability. A
player could build *four Infantry divisions* (2,660 IC days) for a
roughly equivalent cost.

Paratroopers do have some positives:

-   Fun to use
-   Provide an extra envelopment angle if dropped into a battle. The
    bonus is then added to all your divisions engaged in the battle.
-   Paratroopers can be dropped into an empty province behind the enemy
    to close encirclements.
-   Paratroopers dropped on unprotected airfields will destroy all
    planes based there.
-   After an enemy loses a battle and is retreating into an adjacent
    province, if that province is empty, paratroopers can "overrun" the
    retreating enemy to destroy them. This can also be used defensively.
-   In critical battles, paratroopers can swing the outcome,
    specifically during amphibious assaults when only a relatively small
    number of marines can be used. Dropping paratroopers onto the beach
    province dramatically increases the chance of victory.
-   Paratroopers can be used to instantly cover ground that would
    otherwise take weeks for ground forces, such as the huge, low
    infrastructure provinces in C. Asia, Africa and S. America.
