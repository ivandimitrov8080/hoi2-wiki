Assuming normal difficulty, the CG need for your country is determined
as a fraction of your total net IC, modified by all production bonuses.
Generally it can be seen as the middle number in the IC indicator in the
upper right corner of the screen. The formula to compute Consumer goods
need CGN is following:

    CGN = CGF * IC * WT * ME * DPE

where

-   Consumer goods fraction (CGF) - is equal to 0.2
-   War Time Modifier (WT) - is equal to 1 when your nation is in peace
    and 0.5 if you are at war.
-   Minister Effect (ME) - is (100% + sum of minister modifiers to CG
    need)/100% - I have seen it as low as 0.65 and as high as 1.1, but
    it depends on what ministers you ave available.
-   Domestic Policy Effect (DPE) - comes from your slider settings. It
    is computed as (100% + sum of all DP sliders modifiers to CG
    need)/100%. Available sliders that give such modifiers are Democracy
    (+20;-20), Free Trade (-20;+20), Interventionist (+10;+100). Thus
    the value of DPE is 0.7-2.4

##  What the numbers mean 

The modifiers gained from ministers and DP sliders are added separately
and then multiplied. Thus the relative effect from ministers lowering
the CG needs is greater if you are in peace, and have high Democracy,
Free Trade and Isolationist. In an extreme case the net effect of
minister - 20 % CG can be greater than that of + 10 % IC.
