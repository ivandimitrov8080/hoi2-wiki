##  Overview 

Liberia is a small one province country on the southwestern coast of
Africa. Like all other micro-powers it starts with a small outdated
force. It is also limited in expansion prospects and has limited
technical capabilities. However, It has one big thing going for it, and
thats the US of A.

##  Technology 

Like all micro's Liberia only has one tech slot. However, Liberia only
has two tech teams at the beginning, so it isn't that bad. The best
thing to do it research IC techs with the Liberian Rubber Company. It
also helps to get as many blueprints as possible from the USA.

##  Diplomacy 

You start out as a puppet government of the USA. In your position, you
are surrounded by the colonial holdings of France and the Untied
Kingdom.

###  Potential Allies 

##  Economy 

You start off with 2 IC, and the energy and metal to keep those two IC
running. A few extra rare materials can be traded for supplies, but
that's about it. Your manpower gain is 11 per year, but there's simply
not enough IC to use all of it.

##  Intelligence 

It's not worth it to use the intelligence system, since you need the
money for more important things.

##  Armed forces 

###  Army 

You start out with 2 1918 infantry divisions in your one province. Your
best bet is to build only infantry, since your entire country is jungle.

###  Navy 

You start with 1 transport flottila. This is fine for your little
transporting needs. It isn't necessary to build an extensive navy
because as a puppet of America, if you get in wars, then America gets in
the wars too, and America is much more capable of guarding the seas then
you can.

###  Air force 

It's best not to build an air force, since you don't have the manpower
or IC to spare to make planes. Also, your location in Africa means that
you are pretty far away from most action, and your single research slot
is much better used on industrial, infantry and doctrine techs.

##  Strategy 

Try for a land grab near the end of the SCW, to get their reachable
African colonies. Then, when war with Vichy comes, take as much of
Africa as you can.

##    Pro's 

Powerful Ally-USA

##    Con's 

1.Bad tech teams

2.Little chance for outward expansion.

3.No Navy

4.No Air Force

5.Horrid terrain in your country
