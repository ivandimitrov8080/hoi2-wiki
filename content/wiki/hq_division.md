title: "Hq_division"
---

Those units are special divisions, equipped with modern communications
equipment and designed to act as a mobile command centre during the
battle. When staffed with a General or a Field Marshall, HQ units bestow
the following benefits:

-   One leader assumes command of all the corps attacking from one
    province and the HQ doubles this overall command capacity in an
    attack. *Note:* If any leader is commanding more divisions than his
    command limit, the bonus for that leader's skill and traits are
    lost. The doubling refers to the total number of divisions in an
    attack.
-   The HQ doubling effect does not refer to the number of divisions
    that a leader can command in his own formation. A FM can effectively
    command a maximum of 12 div in his own formation while a General can
    effectively command a maximum of 9 div in his own formation. An HQ
    does not change the formation command capacity.
-   All divisions present on the battlefield receive a small
    attack/defence bonus.
-   There is greater chance for [Combat
    Events](/Combat_Events "Combat Events") to happen.
-   There is a small increase to a corps' Effective Supply Efficiency if
    a HQ is in the province or adjacent to the province. Pause over the
    ESE information to get the rollover which explains how this is
    calcuated. ESE combat effects such as being over one's Transport
    Capacity are shown as a combat modifier for each division in a
    battle.
