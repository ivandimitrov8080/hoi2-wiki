title: "Cold_war"
---

A mod that was intended to focus on the Cold War era. It was intended to
span the 1955-1995 time period and aims to be as historically accurate
as possible. It was never released publicly though an alpha copy was
banded around between some forum members for a short while.

All activity was ceased around 2008 and the mod can be realistically
considered dead. It was not released and stands no chance of being
released now.
