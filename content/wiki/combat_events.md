When your forces are engaged in combat, they may trigger a **Combat
Event** . The effects of these events last for eight hours of game time.
You will have an increased chance for a favorable event if you have a
[HQ Division](/HQ_Division "HQ Division") involved or in a province
adjacent to the battle. In version 1.3, the likelihood of getting an
event was also enhanced for fast moving units:

\- The chance for a Encirclement or Breakthrough will now happen 10%
more often for every 1 km/h over 3 km/h. There is a cap on 40%.

\- Units retreating to enemy-controlled territory with enemy units in
both target and source province will now be eliminated.

Four events benefit the attacker and three help the defender. They
usually affect the strength and/or organisation damage a unit suffers.
Some reduce damage for one side. Some give a tradeoff between the
Strength damage inflicted on your units and the Organisation inflicted
on the enemy. This is beneficial for the battle in question, because
units retreat based on their organisation level.

Combat events add flavour to the game and help it model some aspects of
doctrine that otherwise wouldn't. However, you have very little control
of them.

##  Land Doctrine and Combat Events 

The events that occur are determined by your
[doctrine](/Land_Doctrine_FAQ "Land Doctrine FAQ") - which tree you are
on and how far you ave researched.

The German tree is exceptionally strong on the events that aid the
offensive, particularly Breakthrough and Encirclement. Stronger
defensive events turn up later on. On the whole the German tree gets the
most events. The German tree also gets the most effect from HQs.

The US tree is slightly balanced towards defensive events, particularly
Counterattacks. The main offensive event is the Assault. The US tree is
very strong overall.

The Russian tree focuses on events that sap enemy organisation at the
expense of its own units strength. On the offensive this means Assaults
and on the defensive Counterattacks. Until 1941 it is very weak of
defense, and thereafter moderate on the defensive. It gets later on
strong breakthrough chance.

The Grand Battle Plan tree starts off the strongest tree, with a high
number of Counterattack and Delay defensive events. However, it is
totally eclipsed on attack by 1940 and a very poor offensive performer
until 1942, when it splits.

From that point, the Japanese (Infiltration Assault) tree develops many
Ambush events; the French (Attritional Containment) tree develops many
Assaults; and the British (Operational Stages) tree is well-balanced.

##  Combat Event In-game Text 

###  For the attacker: 

####  Assault 

*"This represents a particularly forceful sustained attack where the
attackers will suffer higher strength losses than normal but will
inflict much higher organisation damage to the defenders"*

Assaults are most common from nations high up the Russian and French
Land Doctrine tree. It also fits well with a "Russian" play style with
plentiful units and manpower.

####  Encirclement 

*"This indicates that the attacking force has briefly managed to pin
down and encircle the defenders in a small area of the province. While
this effect lasts the defenders will suffer much higher strength losses
and the attacker will rarely suffer very much loss of organisation
(although they may sustain the normal strength losses"*

####  Ambush 

*"The attacker has managed to ambush the enemy forces inflicting much
higher rates of strength and morale damage to the defenders while at the
same time greatly reducing the amount of those same types of losses that
they sustain themselves"*

####  Breakthrough 

*"The attacker has managed to overrun an enemy's defences in part of the
province. This will seriously disrupt the defender's organisation and
reduce the strength losses sustained by the attacker"*

###  For the defender: 

####  Counterattack 

*"This is a concerted attempt by the defending side to launch a minor
counter-offensive to disrupt the enemy's plans. While the defenders will
suffer somewhat higher strength losses during this period they will
inflict significant organisation losses on the attacker"*

####  Delay 

*"The defending side is employing a delaying action that greatly reduces
the amount of strength loss it sustains during this time"*

####  Tactical Withdrawal 

*"During this period the defender is making a careful tactical
withdrawal to a preferred combat location in the province. Both sides
will sustain reduced levels of strength and organisation loss but the
defender will sustain even lower organisation losses than the attacker"*

When your forces are engaged in combat, they may trigger a **Combat
Event** . The effects of these events last for eight hours of game time.
You will have an increased chance for a favorable event if you have a
[HQ Division](/HQ_Division "HQ Division") involved or in a province
adjacent to the battle. In version 1.3, the likelihood of getting an
event was also enhanced for fast moving units:

\- The chance for a Encirclement or Breakthrough will now happen 10%
more often for every 1 km/h over 3 km/h. There is a cap on 40%.

\- Units retreating to enemy-controlled territory with enemy units in
both target and source province will now be eliminated.

Four events benefit the attacker and three help the defender. They
usually affect the strength and/or organisation damage a unit suffers.
Some reduce damage for one side. Some give a tradeoff between the
Strength damage inflicted on your units and the Organisation inflicted
on the enemy. This is beneficial for the battle in question, because
units retreat based on their organisation level.

Combat events add flavour to the game and help it model some aspects of
doctrine that otherwise wouldn't. However, you have very little control
of them.

##  Land Doctrine and Combat Events 

The events that occur are determined by your
[doctrine](/Land_Doctrine_FAQ "Land Doctrine FAQ") - which tree you are
on and how far you ave researched.

The German tree is exceptionally strong on the events that aid the
offensive, particularly Breakthrough and Encirclement. Stronger
defensive events turn up later on. On the whole the German tree gets the
most events. The German tree also gets the most effect from HQs.

The US tree is slightly balanced towards defensive events, particularly
Counterattacks. The main offensive event is the Assault. The US tree is
very strong overall.

The Russian tree focuses on events that sap enemy organisation at the
expense of its own units strength. On the offensive this means Assaults
and on the defensive Counterattacks. Until 1941 it is very weak of
defense, and thereafter moderate on the defensive. It gets later on
strong breakthrough chance.

The Grand Battle Plan tree starts off the strongest tree, with a high
number of Counterattack and Delay defensive events. However, it is
totally eclipsed on attack by 1940 and a very poor offensive performer
until 1942, when it splits.

From that point, the Japanese (Infiltration Assault) tree develops many
Ambush events; the French (Attritional Containment) tree develops many
Assaults; and the British (Operational Stages) tree is well-balanced.

##  Combat Event In-game Text 

###  For the attacker: 

####  Assault 

*"This represents a particularly forceful sustained attack where the
attackers will suffer higher strength losses than normal but will
inflict much higher organisation damage to the defenders"*

Assaults are most common from nations high up the Russian and French
Land Doctrine tree. It also fits well with a "Russian" play style with
plentiful units and manpower.

####  Encirclement 

*"This indicates that the attacking force has briefly managed to pin
down and encircle the defenders in a small area of the province. While
this effect lasts the defenders will suffer much higher strength losses
and the attacker will rarely suffer very much loss of organisation
(although they may sustain the normal strength losses"*

####  Ambush 

*"The attacker has managed to ambush the enemy forces inflicting much
higher rates of strength and morale damage to the defenders while at the
same time greatly reducing the amount of those same types of losses that
they sustain themselves"*

####  Breakthrough 

*"The attacker has managed to overrun an enemy's defences in part of the
province. This will seriously disrupt the defender's organisation and
reduce the strength losses sustained by the attacker"*

###  For the defender: 

####  Counterattack 

*"This is a concerted attempt by the defending side to launch a minor
counter-offensive to disrupt the enemy's plans. While the defenders will
suffer somewhat higher strength losses during this period they will
inflict significant organisation losses on the attacker"*

####  Delay 

*"The defending side is employing a delaying action that greatly reduces
the amount of strength loss it sustains during this time"*

####  Tactical Withdrawal 

*"During this period the defender is making a careful tactical
withdrawal to a preferred combat location in the province. Both sides
will sustain reduced levels of strength and organisation loss but the
defender will sustain even lower organisation losses than the attacker"*
