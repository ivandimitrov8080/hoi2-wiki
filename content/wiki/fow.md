**Fog of War** (FOW) is the term used to describe the inability to see
certain
[areas](/index.php?title=Areas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Areas (page does not exist)")
on the
[map](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&redlink=1 "Map (page does not exist)")
and what is present in them, usually due to a lack of your own units or
territories nearby to provide "reconnaissance".
