##  Overview 

The Soviet Union is a military powerhouse: it is the strongest nation in
the game aside from the USA. Playing as the Soviet Union is relatively
easy, and is often suggested for new players. New players can keep it
simple, make many mistakes and yet still win! The Soviet Union has a
huge advantage over Germany, especially if the game starts in 1936. Some
of the advantages are:

-   Five years of peace to build the military
-   Large starting industry
-   Good technology teams
-   Self sufficient with resources
-   Good leaders

##  Technology 

The Soviet Union has above average technology teams. Start by
researching industry technologies research industry bonuses and research
time bonuses, do not research more than 1 year ahead of time. Only start
to research military technology when industry technologies is to far
ahead of time and only research what you will use. Air technology,
particularly CAS and TAC, are next in importance though by no means
essential, and naval technology can safely be ignored.

The most important thing to do if you are playing the 1936 campaign is
to change from the Soviet doctrine to Spearhead doctrine since the game
and all of its mechanics greatly benefits organization. And the bonuses
to tanks and mobile infantry are also very good.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Potential Allies 

The USSR is essentially alone in the world, with *only two*
opportunities for a new alliance: Brazil and Republican Spain. Due to
these limited options, the best way to grow the Comintern is through the
liberation of conquered land. In Europe, it is not necessary to liberate
countries manually: with the defeat of Germany an event that "redraws
the borders" will create Eastern European puppet states. A final option
for growing the Comintern is through using coups, as discussed in the
intelligence section below.

####  Brazil 

As a Left-wing radical nation, if the USSR establishes +200 relations,
bringing Brazil into the Comintern will have a 31% chance (assuming
Normal difficulty, and assuming Brazil does not change government types
after an election). As a practical matter, getting Brazil into the
Comintern is requires considerable financial resources. Even after
normalizing relations through trade (e.g. a trade agreement will bring
relations to +50 over the next year), around 15 "influence" actions
would be necessary, at a cost of around $100 each (assuming 2
intervention moves), requiring a total of $1500. Brazil as an ally is
not a particularly strong strategic partner during a historical WW2.
During a late game, after the defeat of the Axis, if the cold war
becomes WW3 then Brazil would act as an important strategic foothold in
the Americas.

####  Communist China 

Historically, Communist China and the Soviet Union had a very tepid
relationship, which is partly reflected in the game. While they begin
with +99 relations, even with +200 relations with Communist China, there
is a 0% chance for them to join the Comintern! Yet, a successful
Communist China can be a helpful strategic Ally against Japan. In order
for Communist China to be successful, two things are necessary:

-   Make a free trade with Communist China to provide them some
    supplies, metals, energy, and rares.
-   Nationalist China: In March or April, 1936, Nationalist China will
    have the Xi'an Incident. They **must** select "Arrest them all as
    traitors!" in order for Communist China to stay at war with the
    Nationalists, signaling the failure of the United Front. The chance
    the AI will select this option is only 10%, according to event 90.

####  Republican Spain 

On July 18, 1936, the Spanish Civil War will begin. Republican Spain
will usually loose when the player is the Soviet Union; while the
Nationalists will usually loose if the player is Germany. Thus, since a
Soviet game is weighted against the Republicans, you can choose to
ignore them completely, or make dedicated efforts to intervene in order
to gain an important strategic partner in Western Europe.

If the Soviet player chooses to intervene, begin by sending aid to
Republican Spain through the event. Immediately after that, send some
free resources to the Republicans. Most importantly, however, the Soviet
Union will need to have some transports (e.g. by building them at the
beginning of the game), and send its relatively weak fleet to the shores
of Spain to attack Nationalist Spain. Only an outright assault by Soviet
forces will guarantee a Republican victory. The Soviet Union must do
everything necessary for the Republicans to win by April 3rd, 1937. If
Republican Spain annexes Nationalist Spain within this two month period
until June 3rd, 1937, the Republicans will crush the Anarchists, and
Spain will become "Left-Wing Radical". This then means that with +200
relations, they will have a 30% chance of joining the Comintern and
radically shifting the balance of power in Western Europe.

A Republican Spain under military control by the Soviet player can mass
troops on its Northern border. This then demands a serious military
commitment from Germany, which results in a much smaller force on the
Soviet border. If Vichy France does not join the Axis, Republican Spain
can easily become an impenetrable barrier to Germany, which would only
be able to access Spain via one mountainous land province.

###  Sliders 

The USSR will receive historical events that move the Diplomatic Sliders
to within one step of full Hawk (Zet offensive, Chasan Lake, Khalkin
Ghol) and within three steps of full Interventionism by 1940. There are
several primary ways to adjust sliders:

-   In 1936 move Hawk. Then move standing army. Then use GoI to get the
    rest of your intervention slider moves. Each move towards standing
    army gives 2% more organization along with cheaper upgrades.
-   In 1936 move Hawk. In 1937, 1938, 1939 move to interventionism (both
    will be max in 1939). In 1940, move towards Standing Army. This
    method provides Standing Army bonuses earlier.
-   If the Soviet player will not purge the officers: In 1936, 1937 &
    1938 move Hawk (Hawk will be max by 1939). In 1939, 1940, 1941, move
    towards Interventionism, then Standing Army in 1942. This method
    provides Hawk production bonuses earlier.
-   One way to avoid the interventionism slider moves is to use Blue
    Emu's Albania Gambit and Guarantee the Independence (GOI) of Albania
    or other European countries that will likely be attacked such as
    Denmark or Luxembourg. Each violation of a GoI gives two
    Intervention slider moves. In this way, the move to Standing Army
    can begin as early as 1937, or when not purging the officers, in
    1939.

###  Ministers 

The USSR has the worst ministers of any major power, and very few useful
ministers to choose from over the course of the game.

In 1937, two new ministers become available which are worthwhile to
change: Uritskij –10% consumer goods, and Shaposhnikov +25% manpower –5%
Infantry.

No minister changes are needed after 1937.

##  Intelligence 

Historically, the Soviet Union had one of the best spy networks in the
world. Unfortunately, the game does not reflect these advancements.
Fortunately, in the early game the USSR makes a fairly large sum of
money due to the enormous dissent levels the USSR must get rid of, which
allows a player to address the first intelligence concern: create 10
spies in your own country, and then begin counter-espionage efforts.

Intelligence can be used for two primary gains:

-   Stealing blueprints from your more advanced adversaries. Focus on
    Germany, Japan, UK, and USA.
-   Couping minor nations (such as Turkey, Finland, Greece, Bulgaria,
    etc)

##  Economy 

The Soviet economy has the potential to rival the US economy through
massive IC building in the early game.

###  Trades 

The USSR begins the game with two trades to Germany. Naturally, it is in
the best interest of the USSR not to trade with Germany, since they are
short of key resources. That being technically true, most players
consider it gamey/unfair to not trade with Germany.

On January 2nd, 1936, you will have 700+ spare energy, 200+ metal, and
100 rares to trade away. Not many countries will give you a good deal
due to your lower relations, however these nations are decent trading
partners at the beginning of the game:

-   Japan
-   USA
-   Germany
-   France
-   Italy
-   Bulgaria
-   Hungary
-   Yugoslavia
-   Rumania
-   Poland

###  Production 

Generally, a series of 4 to 5 runs is considered the most appropriate
for the USSR, since the war will not start in earnest until the summer
of 1941. Running factories for 3 series ends by November, 1938
(depending on your slider moves); while a 4 series run ends October,
1939; and a 5 series run will end in October 1940. The USSR can support
a maximum effective IC of 550 with its native resources. But you will
have built up a reserve of raw materials that with proper trading could
enable you to have an effective IC of 1000.

The use of IC towards upgrades is most effective as your technology
increases, since upgrading units from 1918 infantry directly to 1941
infantry, for example, is much cheaper than doing the upgrade from 1918
to 1936 to 1939 to 1941. Also, dissent will come again during the great
purge, and is best paid down after the Hawk (reduced dissent) and
Interventionism (reduced demand for consumer goods) sliders are working
to your maximum advantage. It is essential to get rid of all dissent
before war with Germany, and is easily achievable before event the
Winter War.

##  Military 

The key to the Soviet military is industry. The Soviet Union can produce
a large amount of Tanks and motorized infantry and. These units make it
possible to win quickly against Germany. Head Quarters (HQ) will soon
become a key to Soviet success in conducting counter-attacks. A key
tactical point is to change the Soviet military doctrines for Spearhead
which makes it easier to win the game.

Air support is used by more advanced players to decimate the German
forces more quickly, primarily with CAS and TAC.

###  Early Annexations 

Generally, the Soviet player has no need to create early wars, and very
little to gain, from early annexations. Generally, the small IC gain
(about 2 total IC gain) plus the dissent caused by a declaration of war
does not make these wars a wise/efficient decision. SOV also have very
low Ground Defence Efficiency \[see below\] which means much higher
casualties in any early wars.

###  The Great Officer Purge 

In March, 1938, the event "The Great Officer Purge" fires. It is one of
the most punitive events in the entire game, and is certainly the worst
event that happens to the Soviet Union. You have two options:

-   Purge the Traitors: Gain 10% dissent, lose 10 manpower and 170
    military leaders. 60 historical leaders will be killed, *in addition
    to* 110 randomly selected leaders. Additionally, lose six ministers
    and two technology teams.
-   No need for Brutality: Gain 30% dissent, Hawk sliders move 2 towards
    Dove.

Purging the officers is typically seen as the most beneficial strategy
for the following reasons:

-   The Soviet Union has a very large number of leaders
-   The extra 20% dissent penalty from "no need for brutality" has a
    significantly negative economic affect
-   The two moves to Dove from "no need for brutality" erase the 10%
    production bonus, and reduce dissent growth to -2% (from -6%) and
    manpower growth to just 2% (from 6%). Additionally, if you purge,
    the Soviet Union only needs one slider move (in 1936) towards Hawk.
    The rest can be done via events (mostly Soviet influence in China)
    and via Guarantees of Independence in Europe. Standing army means
    more organization and cheaper upgrades: By 1941 you can have 12 more
    organization with upgrades at 25% (from the army slider) instead of
    50%. The net effect is 50% vs 75% including the Central Planning
    effects).

Some players advocate for saving the officers for the following reasons:

-   Roleplaying a more benevolent USSR
-   Saving historical leaders (such as Zhukov) that may have be randomly
    purged by the event
-   Using a Soviet strategy that is \*not\* manpower/attrition focused,
    and could benefit from stronger leaders
-   Tech team Alksnis, level 6, is the only team that can research air
    doctrines until 1940
-   Tech team Tukhachevsky, level 5, is better than Shaposhnikov
-   Minister Berzin, Head of Intelligence, is the only minister who
    provides a 5% research bonus
-   Minister Alksnis, Chief of Air Force, is the only minister who
    provides bonuses for fighters and interceptors.

###  Soviet Ground Defense Efficiency 

[Red Army soldiers in
Stalingrad](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Sov-stalingrad.jpg "File:Sov-stalingrad.jpg")

####  In Hearts of Iron 2 

In order to simulate the ineffectiveness of Soviet defenses before the
war with Germany, the Soviet Union has significant defensive penalties
for its military that cannot be adjusted in-game by the player. The GDE
(Ground Defense Efficiency) score is essentially a percentage of the
effectiveness of your units on defense. Thus, a GDE of 0.2 means 20%
effective, or put another way, fighting at an 80% penalty when on the
defense. The normal value of GDE for other nations is 0.8: due to all
the advantages defenders have in the game, GDE never rises above 0.8.

-   The Soviet Union starts with 0.2 GDE.
-   It increases by 0.1 in May 1940 and later years for a total of +0.4.
-   When anyone DOWs you get all these future increases plus an
    additional 0.1 are received.
-   When Finns offer you peace through the event you get +0.1 (note this
    is the event not any other offer of peace).
-   Grand total gets you back to 0.8.
-   AI gets +0.6 at the start instead of the above events EXCEPT that
    they still get the Winter War event allowing the AI to get 0.9 GDE.

Timeline of GDE values:

-   Prior to Dec 12th, 1939, your GDE should be 0.2
-   From Dec 12th, 1939 to May 1st, 1940, it should be 0.3
-   From May 2nd, 1940 to May 1st, 1941, it should be 0.4
-   From May 2nd, 1941 to May 1st, 1942, it should be 0.5
-   From May 2nd, 1942 to May 1st, 1943, it should be 0.6
-   From May 2nd, 1943 to May 1st, 1944, it should be 0.7
-   From May 2nd, 1944 on, it should be 0.8

Being attacked by a major power (eg: Germany) will automatically boost
your GDE up to 0.7 (after a random delay of a few weeks to as much as
several months)... but ONLY if they attack you, not vice versa; and the
last boost (from 0.7 to 0.8 GDE) only happens in 1944, regardless. Note
that all of this applies ONLY to a Human-controlled Russia... an
AI-controlled Russia has a GDE of 0.8 right from January 1936 on.

Details are available in [this
thread](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=201702) .

####  In Doomsday or Armageddon 

There is a different event chain in Doomsday and Armageddon. One
important difference is that the Finnish Winter War has no effect on the
GDE. The Winter War is fought at 0.4 GDE. Then there are two GDE gearing
up events in January 1940 and June 1940, raising GDE to 0.5 and then 0.6
GDE. In June ´41 the GDE gets the last but one raise to 0.7 GDE. The
last raise to 0.8 GDE depends on whether the Soviet Union is human or AI
controlled. The AI gets maximum GDE when they lost 10% of their
provinces in the "Great Patriotic War" event. A human controlled Soviet
Union gets the same event when it is under attack (!), lost 5% of its
territory and lost one major western city OR by June ´42 at the latest.

###  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 

-   No Deal with the Enemies of the Workers: This option does not
    provide any benefits to the player.
-   Accept the pact: You will receive many free territory claims as well
    as a free slider move towards Interventionism.
-   Propose an alliance with Germany: If it is accepted, the USSR will
    be in the Axis. It will lead to a bizarre game where fascists and
    communists are allied together to defeat democracy.

####  Historic Molotov Ribbentrop national provinces: 

It is not necessary to declare war on the Baltic States (Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia) if SOV get the historic Moltov Ribbentrop treaty.
Beginning on May 17, 1940, the USSR will have a 20% chance of
successfully demanding territory (in the Diplomacy screen) to annex the
Baltic States. Historically the Baltic states folded in stages in spring
and summer 1940. You can also use the acceptall diplomatic cheat to
simulate the historic events. Romania should also give up three
Bessarabian provinces via the Pact on 27 JUN 1940.

###  The Winter War 

[KV-2 heavy
tank](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=KW-2.jpg "File:KW-2.jpg")

Assuming [Poland](/Poland "Poland") has been annexed by Germany, a
historical event fires in November 1939. The event gives you an option
to give an ultimatumn to Finland, demanding two border provinces near
Leningrad (Viipuri and Sortavala). AI Finland refuses to cede over the
provinces 99% of the time, triggering a war. It is generally best to
press claims as Stalin did historically since refusing to demand the
provinces changes your Interventionism value by -1.

If you plan to choose the "Press claims" option and therefore almost
certainly start the war, it's best that you prepare for the conflict
before it breaks out, during the summer months of 1939. Remember to
concentrate your army near the Finnish border in time. Also if you
haven't upgraded your divisions by now prioritize the divisions you're
planning to use for the war and move the upgrade slider just enough to
turn their equipment more lethal.

####  The quick way to win 

Send most of your mobile troops to the Finnish border around june of
1939, including your starting 10 Motorized Divisions and 4 tank
divisions. Use these 14 divisions as your main strike force: split them
up into 2 motorized and one tank division. Deploy close to 30 infantry
divisions close to the Finnish border and have at least one 11 division
plus the one "Stavka" the hq unit in one big army under a Field Marshal.
To win quickly in less than a month attack the middle of Finland and do
NOT attack the fortified areas, you only need to take a few of the
middle provinces cutting Finland in half and then a screen will pop up
where you can get what you originally asked for or take the whole of
Finland.

There is an interesting alternative approach: build 2+ transports and
make landing on Finnish costal provinces (including Turku and Vaasa) and
send one huge juggernout to Viipuri-Helsinki. You don't need Marines
because there is no defense usually. If things go well, you'll annex
Finland in 7 days without diplomatic penalty before peace event fires.

####  The end of the Finnish Winter War 

Once you've taken Helsinki or approximately four Finnish provinces,
event \#2627 will fire. You'll get a chance to re-state your ultimatumn,
which this time will be accepted 99% of the time, or continue the war in
hopes of annexation ("Let's bring them Socialism!").

This time deciding which option is the best one is a bit more debatable.
Settling for two provinces bordering Leningrad means that you'll have to
divert your attention (and around 20-30 divisions) to the northern front
once Operation Barbarossa starts, while going for the annexation shoots
up not only your Interventionism (by 1) but your belligerence as well,
and immediately ends any existing non-aggression pacts with Germany,
France, Great Britain and USA. Both selections also have their positive
effects: Settling for two provinces lowers your dissent value by an
impressive 10 (altough there's a 1% chance it goes up by 5), and
annexation means you get the IC's and resources of Finland. If your
dissent is over 10%, then it's a no-brainer to settle what you asked
for. But otherwise it's up to you.

##  War with Germany 

Everything the USSR player does should be directed towards the ultimate
war in Germany, which will usually begin around June 22, 1941. The
player should ensure that all dissent is gone, and all upgrades are
complete before June, 1941. At the beginning of the war, an event will
ask regarding the movement of industry to Siberia. There is no reason
not to accept this event, as it greatly helps the USSR.

  

##  The really quick way to win 

To win quickly against Germany all you need to do is this

-   In 1936 change the doctrine from Soviet land Doctrine to Spearhead

&nbsp;

-   Make sure to build industry all the way up to Feb 1940

&nbsp;

-   In Feb 1940 start to build Motorized infantry and tank divisions.

&nbsp;

-   When Germany Is in France, but before France, has fallen attack
    Germany or Romania, Romania can be a better choice since then
    Germany will Declare war upon you.

By doing these 4 things you are guaranteed to win before the end of 1940
despite the fact that your Gde is very gimped.

What you need to do is to have 2 motorized divisions for every 1 tank
division and each one under a skilled Major General, and for every 12
divisions place a field marshal.

Research tactical bomber and fighter technologies since you already have
some built, and upgrades those before you attack.

By correctly attacking and using your air power you can win over Germany
in late 1940.

###    Force Deployment & Tactics 

If you choose not to attack in 1940 but want to wait for the Axis to
attack you then you should build up your industry all the way until
summer 1940.

By starting on building up industry in 1936 preferably to the east of
Moscow so that it is hard to get to by enemy forces, and using ALL
available IC to build industry. Make sure to asign all divisions under
logistical wizards so that they consume as little goods as possible and
do not reinforce them until you need them.

Only reinforce those units you are going to use in the winter war and
only upgrade those and do it at during the summer of 39.

Make sure that you have researched the spearhead doctrine since it is
several times better then the games “soviet land doctrine”, doctrine.
And the point is to win as quickly and as easily as possible.

If you do this and do it properly then by the Summer of 1940 you should
have an effective IC anywhere from 650-850 depending on how well you
trade and what slider options you have chosen.

During the summer of 1940 start by building tanks and motorized
divisions and tactical fighters and headquarters. When the war comes in
1941 you will have a large motorized army which can easily destroy the
attacking axis within a few month and you never need to lose a single
province.

  

###  Winning the Easy Way with the Soviet land Doctrine 

The Soviet Union is extremely powerful, and beating Germany is quite
easy using the correct approach. Two simple steps, also known as
"spamming industry & infantry", will ensure an easy victory:

-   3 rounds of using all IC for factory building
-   Then, massive parallel serialized builds of infantry (though taking
    care to pay down all dissent, upgrades, and reinforcements): 400-500
    infantry by the time of Barbarrosa is a good figure. Combined with
    Milita, and the USSR can easily attain 600+ army units.

Using this method, it is possible to never surrender a single province
to Germany, and to essentially go on the offensive at the very beginning
of the war. In fact, if done with careful effeciency, the Soviet
military will be so strong and so overpowering that the German AI,
knowing how massive the Soviet army is, will not dare declare war! If a
Soviet game goes into the summer of 1942 without a German declaration of
war, it means the Soviet player has created a massive military that will
steam roll Germany all the way to Berlin and beyond. :)

##  Alternative War Options 

###  War with China 

For the expansive player who likes to conquer everything in sight, an
oft neglected direction is China in 1936. Why China? It's a large land
mass that no one in the west is going to go to war with you over. I
generally do not like to share with anyone so I personally often find
ways to eliminate or isolate Mongolia from the war effort, but that's of
minor importance. Their are two main ways to enter China. Either you can
smash through Japan and her puppet Manchouko, which will bring you into
war with Japan as well which you probably don't want.

Or you can skip war with Japan all together by invading through
Sinkiang. The main problem here is that invading through Sinkiang means
crossing those damn mountains and that can take 6 months to a year, if
not more. Additionally you should either have conquered Mongolia (puppet
state of USSR I know, but still) or moved troops their so they can
invade Shanxi. Main reason? Keeping the Japanese out.

The two times I've done it, Japan did not go to war with China, but I
don't guarantee that they won't, however, you don't have to go war with
them. If that happens you'll be in a race with Japan to capture all the
territory you can.

It is a tough war though, and winter 37 is going to be very tough.
Generally going through a careful step by step invasion process pushing
for the pacific, you can be done with war in China by late 1938
(including all warlord states) no later than may of 39, so you can still
have all your army back in Europe just in time for the winter war.
You'll have the advantage of going into the winter war, and then world
war 2 with the most experienced army in the whole game. In fact, I'd
recommend that any units left behind in China be newer units so you can
fully benefit from that edge.

From this point on, the war in the game should play out as mentioned in
the war with Germany section, other than the advantage you'll get in
additional manpower, resources, and IC, but of course, you're not going
to war with China because you need something. You're doing it because it
seemed like a fun idea, (at least in my case)

Additionally, if you're looking for war with england, you'll suddenly
find yourself in perfect location for a two pronged strike into India.
However if you do this, you still need to keep a strong army at the
polish (and later german) border because Germany will declare war on you
no matter what you're doing to England.

##  Multiplayer Suggestions 

In a Multiplayer game, Germany is the most serious enemy of the Soviet
Union, and will typically force Barbarrosa in May, 1940. Germany will be
technically superior to the Soviet Union in every way at this time, and
may even have more industrial capacity. Wise German adversaries will
focus on land doctrines, infantry, armor, and air superiority. All
German units, especially in 1940, will be a level more advanced than
Soviet units.

To win easily in Multilayer as the USSR if you start in the 1936
scenario change to Spearhead doctrine, Build industry for 2-3 rounds and
then build motorized units and tanks and combine them in 1 tank 2
motorized groups each specific division under s killed Major General and
of course 1 Field Marshal for every 12 Divisions that you have

##  Overview 

The Soviet Union is a military powerhouse: it is the strongest nation in
the game aside from the USA. Playing as the Soviet Union is relatively
easy, and is often suggested for new players. New players can keep it
simple, make many mistakes and yet still win! The Soviet Union has a
huge advantage over Germany, especially if the game starts in 1936. Some
of the advantages are:

-   Five years of peace to build the military
-   Large starting industry
-   Good technology teams
-   Self sufficient with resources
-   Good leaders

##  Technology 

The Soviet Union has above average technology teams. Start by
researching industry technologies research industry bonuses and research
time bonuses, do not research more than 1 year ahead of time. Only start
to research military technology when industry technologies is to far
ahead of time and only research what you will use. Air technology,
particularly CAS and TAC, are next in importance though by no means
essential, and naval technology can safely be ignored.

The most important thing to do if you are playing the 1936 campaign is
to change from the Soviet doctrine to Spearhead doctrine since the game
and all of its mechanics greatly benefits organization. And the bonuses
to tanks and mobile infantry are also very good.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Potential Allies 

The USSR is essentially alone in the world, with *only two*
opportunities for a new alliance: Brazil and Republican Spain. Due to
these limited options, the best way to grow the Comintern is through the
liberation of conquered land. In Europe, it is not necessary to liberate
countries manually: with the defeat of Germany an event that "redraws
the borders" will create Eastern European puppet states. A final option
for growing the Comintern is through using coups, as discussed in the
intelligence section below.

####  Brazil 

As a Left-wing radical nation, if the USSR establishes +200 relations,
bringing Brazil into the Comintern will have a 31% chance (assuming
Normal difficulty, and assuming Brazil does not change government types
after an election). As a practical matter, getting Brazil into the
Comintern is requires considerable financial resources. Even after
normalizing relations through trade (e.g. a trade agreement will bring
relations to +50 over the next year), around 15 "influence" actions
would be necessary, at a cost of around $100 each (assuming 2
intervention moves), requiring a total of $1500. Brazil as an ally is
not a particularly strong strategic partner during a historical WW2.
During a late game, after the defeat of the Axis, if the cold war
becomes WW3 then Brazil would act as an important strategic foothold in
the Americas.

####  Communist China 

Historically, Communist China and the Soviet Union had a very tepid
relationship, which is partly reflected in the game. While they begin
with +99 relations, even with +200 relations with Communist China, there
is a 0% chance for them to join the Comintern! Yet, a successful
Communist China can be a helpful strategic Ally against Japan. In order
for Communist China to be successful, two things are necessary:

-   Make a free trade with Communist China to provide them some
    supplies, metals, energy, and rares.
-   Nationalist China: In March or April, 1936, Nationalist China will
    have the Xi'an Incident. They **must** select "Arrest them all as
    traitors!" in order for Communist China to stay at war with the
    Nationalists, signaling the failure of the United Front. The chance
    the AI will select this option is only 10%, according to event 90.

####  Republican Spain 

On July 18, 1936, the Spanish Civil War will begin. Republican Spain
will usually loose when the player is the Soviet Union; while the
Nationalists will usually loose if the player is Germany. Thus, since a
Soviet game is weighted against the Republicans, you can choose to
ignore them completely, or make dedicated efforts to intervene in order
to gain an important strategic partner in Western Europe.

If the Soviet player chooses to intervene, begin by sending aid to
Republican Spain through the event. Immediately after that, send some
free resources to the Republicans. Most importantly, however, the Soviet
Union will need to have some transports (e.g. by building them at the
beginning of the game), and send its relatively weak fleet to the shores
of Spain to attack Nationalist Spain. Only an outright assault by Soviet
forces will guarantee a Republican victory. The Soviet Union must do
everything necessary for the Republicans to win by April 3rd, 1937. If
Republican Spain annexes Nationalist Spain within this two month period
until June 3rd, 1937, the Republicans will crush the Anarchists, and
Spain will become "Left-Wing Radical". This then means that with +200
relations, they will have a 30% chance of joining the Comintern and
radically shifting the balance of power in Western Europe.

A Republican Spain under military control by the Soviet player can mass
troops on its Northern border. This then demands a serious military
commitment from Germany, which results in a much smaller force on the
Soviet border. If Vichy France does not join the Axis, Republican Spain
can easily become an impenetrable barrier to Germany, which would only
be able to access Spain via one mountainous land province.

###  Sliders 

The USSR will receive historical events that move the Diplomatic Sliders
to within one step of full Hawk (Zet offensive, Chasan Lake, Khalkin
Ghol) and within three steps of full Interventionism by 1940. There are
several primary ways to adjust sliders:

-   In 1936 move Hawk. Then move standing army. Then use GoI to get the
    rest of your intervention slider moves. Each move towards standing
    army gives 2% more organization along with cheaper upgrades.
-   In 1936 move Hawk. In 1937, 1938, 1939 move to interventionism (both
    will be max in 1939). In 1940, move towards Standing Army. This
    method provides Standing Army bonuses earlier.
-   If the Soviet player will not purge the officers: In 1936, 1937 &
    1938 move Hawk (Hawk will be max by 1939). In 1939, 1940, 1941, move
    towards Interventionism, then Standing Army in 1942. This method
    provides Hawk production bonuses earlier.
-   One way to avoid the interventionism slider moves is to use Blue
    Emu's Albania Gambit and Guarantee the Independence (GOI) of Albania
    or other European countries that will likely be attacked such as
    Denmark or Luxembourg. Each violation of a GoI gives two
    Intervention slider moves. In this way, the move to Standing Army
    can begin as early as 1937, or when not purging the officers, in
    1939.

###  Ministers 

The USSR has the worst ministers of any major power, and very few useful
ministers to choose from over the course of the game.

In 1937, two new ministers become available which are worthwhile to
change: Uritskij –10% consumer goods, and Shaposhnikov +25% manpower –5%
Infantry.

No minister changes are needed after 1937.

##  Intelligence 

Historically, the Soviet Union had one of the best spy networks in the
world. Unfortunately, the game does not reflect these advancements.
Fortunately, in the early game the USSR makes a fairly large sum of
money due to the enormous dissent levels the USSR must get rid of, which
allows a player to address the first intelligence concern: create 10
spies in your own country, and then begin counter-espionage efforts.

Intelligence can be used for two primary gains:

-   Stealing blueprints from your more advanced adversaries. Focus on
    Germany, Japan, UK, and USA.
-   Couping minor nations (such as Turkey, Finland, Greece, Bulgaria,
    etc)

##  Economy 

The Soviet economy has the potential to rival the US economy through
massive IC building in the early game.

###  Trades 

The USSR begins the game with two trades to Germany. Naturally, it is in
the best interest of the USSR not to trade with Germany, since they are
short of key resources. That being technically true, most players
consider it gamey/unfair to not trade with Germany.

On January 2nd, 1936, you will have 700+ spare energy, 200+ metal, and
100 rares to trade away. Not many countries will give you a good deal
due to your lower relations, however these nations are decent trading
partners at the beginning of the game:

-   Japan
-   USA
-   Germany
-   France
-   Italy
-   Bulgaria
-   Hungary
-   Yugoslavia
-   Rumania
-   Poland

###  Production 

Generally, a series of 4 to 5 runs is considered the most appropriate
for the USSR, since the war will not start in earnest until the summer
of 1941. Running factories for 3 series ends by November, 1938
(depending on your slider moves); while a 4 series run ends October,
1939; and a 5 series run will end in October 1940. The USSR can support
a maximum effective IC of 550 with its native resources. But you will
have built up a reserve of raw materials that with proper trading could
enable you to have an effective IC of 1000.

The use of IC towards upgrades is most effective as your technology
increases, since upgrading units from 1918 infantry directly to 1941
infantry, for example, is much cheaper than doing the upgrade from 1918
to 1936 to 1939 to 1941. Also, dissent will come again during the great
purge, and is best paid down after the Hawk (reduced dissent) and
Interventionism (reduced demand for consumer goods) sliders are working
to your maximum advantage. It is essential to get rid of all dissent
before war with Germany, and is easily achievable before event the
Winter War.

##  Military 

The key to the Soviet military is industry. The Soviet Union can produce
a large amount of Tanks and motorized infantry and. These units make it
possible to win quickly against Germany. Head Quarters (HQ) will soon
become a key to Soviet success in conducting counter-attacks. A key
tactical point is to change the Soviet military doctrines for Spearhead
which makes it easier to win the game.

Air support is used by more advanced players to decimate the German
forces more quickly, primarily with CAS and TAC.

###  Early Annexations 

Generally, the Soviet player has no need to create early wars, and very
little to gain, from early annexations. Generally, the small IC gain
(about 2 total IC gain) plus the dissent caused by a declaration of war
does not make these wars a wise/efficient decision. SOV also have very
low Ground Defence Efficiency \[see below\] which means much higher
casualties in any early wars.

###  The Great Officer Purge 

In March, 1938, the event "The Great Officer Purge" fires. It is one of
the most punitive events in the entire game, and is certainly the worst
event that happens to the Soviet Union. You have two options:

-   Purge the Traitors: Gain 10% dissent, lose 10 manpower and 170
    military leaders. 60 historical leaders will be killed, *in addition
    to* 110 randomly selected leaders. Additionally, lose six ministers
    and two technology teams.
-   No need for Brutality: Gain 30% dissent, Hawk sliders move 2 towards
    Dove.

Purging the officers is typically seen as the most beneficial strategy
for the following reasons:

-   The Soviet Union has a very large number of leaders
-   The extra 20% dissent penalty from "no need for brutality" has a
    significantly negative economic affect
-   The two moves to Dove from "no need for brutality" erase the 10%
    production bonus, and reduce dissent growth to -2% (from -6%) and
    manpower growth to just 2% (from 6%). Additionally, if you purge,
    the Soviet Union only needs one slider move (in 1936) towards Hawk.
    The rest can be done via events (mostly Soviet influence in China)
    and via Guarantees of Independence in Europe. Standing army means
    more organization and cheaper upgrades: By 1941 you can have 12 more
    organization with upgrades at 25% (from the army slider) instead of
    50%. The net effect is 50% vs 75% including the Central Planning
    effects).

Some players advocate for saving the officers for the following reasons:

-   Roleplaying a more benevolent USSR
-   Saving historical leaders (such as Zhukov) that may have be randomly
    purged by the event
-   Using a Soviet strategy that is \*not\* manpower/attrition focused,
    and could benefit from stronger leaders
-   Tech team Alksnis, level 6, is the only team that can research air
    doctrines until 1940
-   Tech team Tukhachevsky, level 5, is better than Shaposhnikov
-   Minister Berzin, Head of Intelligence, is the only minister who
    provides a 5% research bonus
-   Minister Alksnis, Chief of Air Force, is the only minister who
    provides bonuses for fighters and interceptors.

###  Soviet Ground Defense Efficiency 

[Red Army soldiers in
Stalingrad](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Sov-stalingrad.jpg "File:Sov-stalingrad.jpg")

####  In Hearts of Iron 2 

In order to simulate the ineffectiveness of Soviet defenses before the
war with Germany, the Soviet Union has significant defensive penalties
for its military that cannot be adjusted in-game by the player. The GDE
(Ground Defense Efficiency) score is essentially a percentage of the
effectiveness of your units on defense. Thus, a GDE of 0.2 means 20%
effective, or put another way, fighting at an 80% penalty when on the
defense. The normal value of GDE for other nations is 0.8: due to all
the advantages defenders have in the game, GDE never rises above 0.8.

-   The Soviet Union starts with 0.2 GDE.
-   It increases by 0.1 in May 1940 and later years for a total of +0.4.
-   When anyone DOWs you get all these future increases plus an
    additional 0.1 are received.
-   When Finns offer you peace through the event you get +0.1 (note this
    is the event not any other offer of peace).
-   Grand total gets you back to 0.8.
-   AI gets +0.6 at the start instead of the above events EXCEPT that
    they still get the Winter War event allowing the AI to get 0.9 GDE.

Timeline of GDE values:

-   Prior to Dec 12th, 1939, your GDE should be 0.2
-   From Dec 12th, 1939 to May 1st, 1940, it should be 0.3
-   From May 2nd, 1940 to May 1st, 1941, it should be 0.4
-   From May 2nd, 1941 to May 1st, 1942, it should be 0.5
-   From May 2nd, 1942 to May 1st, 1943, it should be 0.6
-   From May 2nd, 1943 to May 1st, 1944, it should be 0.7
-   From May 2nd, 1944 on, it should be 0.8

Being attacked by a major power (eg: Germany) will automatically boost
your GDE up to 0.7 (after a random delay of a few weeks to as much as
several months)... but ONLY if they attack you, not vice versa; and the
last boost (from 0.7 to 0.8 GDE) only happens in 1944, regardless. Note
that all of this applies ONLY to a Human-controlled Russia... an
AI-controlled Russia has a GDE of 0.8 right from January 1936 on.

Details are available in [this
thread](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=201702) .

####  In Doomsday or Armageddon 

There is a different event chain in Doomsday and Armageddon. One
important difference is that the Finnish Winter War has no effect on the
GDE. The Winter War is fought at 0.4 GDE. Then there are two GDE gearing
up events in January 1940 and June 1940, raising GDE to 0.5 and then 0.6
GDE. In June ´41 the GDE gets the last but one raise to 0.7 GDE. The
last raise to 0.8 GDE depends on whether the Soviet Union is human or AI
controlled. The AI gets maximum GDE when they lost 10% of their
provinces in the "Great Patriotic War" event. A human controlled Soviet
Union gets the same event when it is under attack (!), lost 5% of its
territory and lost one major western city OR by June ´42 at the latest.

###  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 

-   No Deal with the Enemies of the Workers: This option does not
    provide any benefits to the player.
-   Accept the pact: You will receive many free territory claims as well
    as a free slider move towards Interventionism.
-   Propose an alliance with Germany: If it is accepted, the USSR will
    be in the Axis. It will lead to a bizarre game where fascists and
    communists are allied together to defeat democracy.

####  Historic Molotov Ribbentrop national provinces: 

It is not necessary to declare war on the Baltic States (Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia) if SOV get the historic Moltov Ribbentrop treaty.
Beginning on May 17, 1940, the USSR will have a 20% chance of
successfully demanding territory (in the Diplomacy screen) to annex the
Baltic States. Historically the Baltic states folded in stages in spring
and summer 1940. You can also use the acceptall diplomatic cheat to
simulate the historic events. Romania should also give up three
Bessarabian provinces via the Pact on 27 JUN 1940.

###  The Winter War 

[KV-2 heavy
tank](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=KW-2.jpg "File:KW-2.jpg")

Assuming [Poland](/Poland "Poland") has been annexed by Germany, a
historical event fires in November 1939. The event gives you an option
to give an ultimatumn to Finland, demanding two border provinces near
Leningrad (Viipuri and Sortavala). AI Finland refuses to cede over the
provinces 99% of the time, triggering a war. It is generally best to
press claims as Stalin did historically since refusing to demand the
provinces changes your Interventionism value by -1.

If you plan to choose the "Press claims" option and therefore almost
certainly start the war, it's best that you prepare for the conflict
before it breaks out, during the summer months of 1939. Remember to
concentrate your army near the Finnish border in time. Also if you
haven't upgraded your divisions by now prioritize the divisions you're
planning to use for the war and move the upgrade slider just enough to
turn their equipment more lethal.

####  The quick way to win 

Send most of your mobile troops to the Finnish border around june of
1939, including your starting 10 Motorized Divisions and 4 tank
divisions. Use these 14 divisions as your main strike force: split them
up into 2 motorized and one tank division. Deploy close to 30 infantry
divisions close to the Finnish border and have at least one 11 division
plus the one "Stavka" the hq unit in one big army under a Field Marshal.
To win quickly in less than a month attack the middle of Finland and do
NOT attack the fortified areas, you only need to take a few of the
middle provinces cutting Finland in half and then a screen will pop up
where you can get what you originally asked for or take the whole of
Finland.

There is an interesting alternative approach: build 2+ transports and
make landing on Finnish costal provinces (including Turku and Vaasa) and
send one huge juggernout to Viipuri-Helsinki. You don't need Marines
because there is no defense usually. If things go well, you'll annex
Finland in 7 days without diplomatic penalty before peace event fires.

####  The end of the Finnish Winter War 

Once you've taken Helsinki or approximately four Finnish provinces,
event \#2627 will fire. You'll get a chance to re-state your ultimatumn,
which this time will be accepted 99% of the time, or continue the war in
hopes of annexation ("Let's bring them Socialism!").

This time deciding which option is the best one is a bit more debatable.
Settling for two provinces bordering Leningrad means that you'll have to
divert your attention (and around 20-30 divisions) to the northern front
once Operation Barbarossa starts, while going for the annexation shoots
up not only your Interventionism (by 1) but your belligerence as well,
and immediately ends any existing non-aggression pacts with Germany,
France, Great Britain and USA. Both selections also have their positive
effects: Settling for two provinces lowers your dissent value by an
impressive 10 (altough there's a 1% chance it goes up by 5), and
annexation means you get the IC's and resources of Finland. If your
dissent is over 10%, then it's a no-brainer to settle what you asked
for. But otherwise it's up to you.

##  War with Germany 

Everything the USSR player does should be directed towards the ultimate
war in Germany, which will usually begin around June 22, 1941. The
player should ensure that all dissent is gone, and all upgrades are
complete before June, 1941. At the beginning of the war, an event will
ask regarding the movement of industry to Siberia. There is no reason
not to accept this event, as it greatly helps the USSR.

  

##  The really quick way to win 

To win quickly against Germany all you need to do is this

-   In 1936 change the doctrine from Soviet land Doctrine to Spearhead

&nbsp;

-   Make sure to build industry all the way up to Feb 1940

&nbsp;

-   In Feb 1940 start to build Motorized infantry and tank divisions.

&nbsp;

-   When Germany Is in France, but before France, has fallen attack
    Germany or Romania, Romania can be a better choice since then
    Germany will Declare war upon you.

By doing these 4 things you are guaranteed to win before the end of 1940
despite the fact that your Gde is very gimped.

What you need to do is to have 2 motorized divisions for every 1 tank
division and each one under a skilled Major General, and for every 12
divisions place a field marshal.

Research tactical bomber and fighter technologies since you already have
some built, and upgrades those before you attack.

By correctly attacking and using your air power you can win over Germany
in late 1940.

###    Force Deployment & Tactics 

If you choose not to attack in 1940 but want to wait for the Axis to
attack you then you should build up your industry all the way until
summer 1940.

By starting on building up industry in 1936 preferably to the east of
Moscow so that it is hard to get to by enemy forces, and using ALL
available IC to build industry. Make sure to asign all divisions under
logistical wizards so that they consume as little goods as possible and
do not reinforce them until you need them.

Only reinforce those units you are going to use in the winter war and
only upgrade those and do it at during the summer of 39.

Make sure that you have researched the spearhead doctrine since it is
several times better then the games “soviet land doctrine”, doctrine.
And the point is to win as quickly and as easily as possible.

If you do this and do it properly then by the Summer of 1940 you should
have an effective IC anywhere from 650-850 depending on how well you
trade and what slider options you have chosen.

During the summer of 1940 start by building tanks and motorized
divisions and tactical fighters and headquarters. When the war comes in
1941 you will have a large motorized army which can easily destroy the
attacking axis within a few month and you never need to lose a single
province.

  

###  Winning the Easy Way with the Soviet land Doctrine 

The Soviet Union is extremely powerful, and beating Germany is quite
easy using the correct approach. Two simple steps, also known as
"spamming industry & infantry", will ensure an easy victory:

-   3 rounds of using all IC for factory building
-   Then, massive parallel serialized builds of infantry (though taking
    care to pay down all dissent, upgrades, and reinforcements): 400-500
    infantry by the time of Barbarrosa is a good figure. Combined with
    Milita, and the USSR can easily attain 600+ army units.

Using this method, it is possible to never surrender a single province
to Germany, and to essentially go on the offensive at the very beginning
of the war. In fact, if done with careful effeciency, the Soviet
military will be so strong and so overpowering that the German AI,
knowing how massive the Soviet army is, will not dare declare war! If a
Soviet game goes into the summer of 1942 without a German declaration of
war, it means the Soviet player has created a massive military that will
steam roll Germany all the way to Berlin and beyond. :)

##  Alternative War Options 

###  War with China 

For the expansive player who likes to conquer everything in sight, an
oft neglected direction is China in 1936. Why China? It's a large land
mass that no one in the west is going to go to war with you over. I
generally do not like to share with anyone so I personally often find
ways to eliminate or isolate Mongolia from the war effort, but that's of
minor importance. Their are two main ways to enter China. Either you can
smash through Japan and her puppet Manchouko, which will bring you into
war with Japan as well which you probably don't want.

Or you can skip war with Japan all together by invading through
Sinkiang. The main problem here is that invading through Sinkiang means
crossing those damn mountains and that can take 6 months to a year, if
not more. Additionally you should either have conquered Mongolia (puppet
state of USSR I know, but still) or moved troops their so they can
invade Shanxi. Main reason? Keeping the Japanese out.

The two times I've done it, Japan did not go to war with China, but I
don't guarantee that they won't, however, you don't have to go war with
them. If that happens you'll be in a race with Japan to capture all the
territory you can.

It is a tough war though, and winter 37 is going to be very tough.
Generally going through a careful step by step invasion process pushing
for the pacific, you can be done with war in China by late 1938
(including all warlord states) no later than may of 39, so you can still
have all your army back in Europe just in time for the winter war.
You'll have the advantage of going into the winter war, and then world
war 2 with the most experienced army in the whole game. In fact, I'd
recommend that any units left behind in China be newer units so you can
fully benefit from that edge.

From this point on, the war in the game should play out as mentioned in
the war with Germany section, other than the advantage you'll get in
additional manpower, resources, and IC, but of course, you're not going
to war with China because you need something. You're doing it because it
seemed like a fun idea, (at least in my case)

Additionally, if you're looking for war with england, you'll suddenly
find yourself in perfect location for a two pronged strike into India.
However if you do this, you still need to keep a strong army at the
polish (and later german) border because Germany will declare war on you
no matter what you're doing to England.

##  Multiplayer Suggestions 

In a Multiplayer game, Germany is the most serious enemy of the Soviet
Union, and will typically force Barbarrosa in May, 1940. Germany will be
technically superior to the Soviet Union in every way at this time, and
may even have more industrial capacity. Wise German adversaries will
focus on land doctrines, infantry, armor, and air superiority. All
German units, especially in 1940, will be a level more advanced than
Soviet units.

To win easily in Multilayer as the USSR if you start in the 1936
scenario change to Spearhead doctrine, Build industry for 2-3 rounds and
then build motorized units and tanks and combine them in 1 tank 2
motorized groups each specific division under s killed Major General and
of course 1 Field Marshal for every 12 Divisions that you have

##  Overview 

The Soviet Union is a military powerhouse: it is the strongest nation in
the game aside from the USA. Playing as the Soviet Union is relatively
easy, and is often suggested for new players. New players can keep it
simple, make many mistakes and yet still win! The Soviet Union has a
huge advantage over Germany, especially if the game starts in 1936. Some
of the advantages are:

-   Five years of peace to build the military
-   Large starting industry
-   Good technology teams
-   Self sufficient with resources
-   Good leaders

##  Technology 

The Soviet Union has above average technology teams. Start by
researching industry technologies research industry bonuses and research
time bonuses, do not research more than 1 year ahead of time. Only start
to research military technology when industry technologies is to far
ahead of time and only research what you will use. Air technology,
particularly CAS and TAC, are next in importance though by no means
essential, and naval technology can safely be ignored.

The most important thing to do if you are playing the 1936 campaign is
to change from the Soviet doctrine to Spearhead doctrine since the game
and all of its mechanics greatly benefits organization. And the bonuses
to tanks and mobile infantry are also very good.

##  Diplomacy 

###  Potential Allies 

The USSR is essentially alone in the world, with *only two*
opportunities for a new alliance: Brazil and Republican Spain. Due to
these limited options, the best way to grow the Comintern is through the
liberation of conquered land. In Europe, it is not necessary to liberate
countries manually: with the defeat of Germany an event that "redraws
the borders" will create Eastern European puppet states. A final option
for growing the Comintern is through using coups, as discussed in the
intelligence section below.

####  Brazil 

As a Left-wing radical nation, if the USSR establishes +200 relations,
bringing Brazil into the Comintern will have a 31% chance (assuming
Normal difficulty, and assuming Brazil does not change government types
after an election). As a practical matter, getting Brazil into the
Comintern is requires considerable financial resources. Even after
normalizing relations through trade (e.g. a trade agreement will bring
relations to +50 over the next year), around 15 "influence" actions
would be necessary, at a cost of around $100 each (assuming 2
intervention moves), requiring a total of $1500. Brazil as an ally is
not a particularly strong strategic partner during a historical WW2.
During a late game, after the defeat of the Axis, if the cold war
becomes WW3 then Brazil would act as an important strategic foothold in
the Americas.

####  Communist China 

Historically, Communist China and the Soviet Union had a very tepid
relationship, which is partly reflected in the game. While they begin
with +99 relations, even with +200 relations with Communist China, there
is a 0% chance for them to join the Comintern! Yet, a successful
Communist China can be a helpful strategic Ally against Japan. In order
for Communist China to be successful, two things are necessary:

-   Make a free trade with Communist China to provide them some
    supplies, metals, energy, and rares.
-   Nationalist China: In March or April, 1936, Nationalist China will
    have the Xi'an Incident. They **must** select "Arrest them all as
    traitors!" in order for Communist China to stay at war with the
    Nationalists, signaling the failure of the United Front. The chance
    the AI will select this option is only 10%, according to event 90.

####  Republican Spain 

On July 18, 1936, the Spanish Civil War will begin. Republican Spain
will usually loose when the player is the Soviet Union; while the
Nationalists will usually loose if the player is Germany. Thus, since a
Soviet game is weighted against the Republicans, you can choose to
ignore them completely, or make dedicated efforts to intervene in order
to gain an important strategic partner in Western Europe.

If the Soviet player chooses to intervene, begin by sending aid to
Republican Spain through the event. Immediately after that, send some
free resources to the Republicans. Most importantly, however, the Soviet
Union will need to have some transports (e.g. by building them at the
beginning of the game), and send its relatively weak fleet to the shores
of Spain to attack Nationalist Spain. Only an outright assault by Soviet
forces will guarantee a Republican victory. The Soviet Union must do
everything necessary for the Republicans to win by April 3rd, 1937. If
Republican Spain annexes Nationalist Spain within this two month period
until June 3rd, 1937, the Republicans will crush the Anarchists, and
Spain will become "Left-Wing Radical". This then means that with +200
relations, they will have a 30% chance of joining the Comintern and
radically shifting the balance of power in Western Europe.

A Republican Spain under military control by the Soviet player can mass
troops on its Northern border. This then demands a serious military
commitment from Germany, which results in a much smaller force on the
Soviet border. If Vichy France does not join the Axis, Republican Spain
can easily become an impenetrable barrier to Germany, which would only
be able to access Spain via one mountainous land province.

###  Sliders 

The USSR will receive historical events that move the Diplomatic Sliders
to within one step of full Hawk (Zet offensive, Chasan Lake, Khalkin
Ghol) and within three steps of full Interventionism by 1940. There are
several primary ways to adjust sliders:

-   In 1936 move Hawk. Then move standing army. Then use GoI to get the
    rest of your intervention slider moves. Each move towards standing
    army gives 2% more organization along with cheaper upgrades.
-   In 1936 move Hawk. In 1937, 1938, 1939 move to interventionism (both
    will be max in 1939). In 1940, move towards Standing Army. This
    method provides Standing Army bonuses earlier.
-   If the Soviet player will not purge the officers: In 1936, 1937 &
    1938 move Hawk (Hawk will be max by 1939). In 1939, 1940, 1941, move
    towards Interventionism, then Standing Army in 1942. This method
    provides Hawk production bonuses earlier.
-   One way to avoid the interventionism slider moves is to use Blue
    Emu's Albania Gambit and Guarantee the Independence (GOI) of Albania
    or other European countries that will likely be attacked such as
    Denmark or Luxembourg. Each violation of a GoI gives two
    Intervention slider moves. In this way, the move to Standing Army
    can begin as early as 1937, or when not purging the officers, in
    1939.

###  Ministers 

The USSR has the worst ministers of any major power, and very few useful
ministers to choose from over the course of the game.

In 1937, two new ministers become available which are worthwhile to
change: Uritskij –10% consumer goods, and Shaposhnikov +25% manpower –5%
Infantry.

No minister changes are needed after 1937.

##  Intelligence 

Historically, the Soviet Union had one of the best spy networks in the
world. Unfortunately, the game does not reflect these advancements.
Fortunately, in the early game the USSR makes a fairly large sum of
money due to the enormous dissent levels the USSR must get rid of, which
allows a player to address the first intelligence concern: create 10
spies in your own country, and then begin counter-espionage efforts.

Intelligence can be used for two primary gains:

-   Stealing blueprints from your more advanced adversaries. Focus on
    Germany, Japan, UK, and USA.
-   Couping minor nations (such as Turkey, Finland, Greece, Bulgaria,
    etc)

##  Economy 

The Soviet economy has the potential to rival the US economy through
massive IC building in the early game.

###  Trades 

The USSR begins the game with two trades to Germany. Naturally, it is in
the best interest of the USSR not to trade with Germany, since they are
short of key resources. That being technically true, most players
consider it gamey/unfair to not trade with Germany.

On January 2nd, 1936, you will have 700+ spare energy, 200+ metal, and
100 rares to trade away. Not many countries will give you a good deal
due to your lower relations, however these nations are decent trading
partners at the beginning of the game:

-   Japan
-   USA
-   Germany
-   France
-   Italy
-   Bulgaria
-   Hungary
-   Yugoslavia
-   Rumania
-   Poland

###  Production 

Generally, a series of 4 to 5 runs is considered the most appropriate
for the USSR, since the war will not start in earnest until the summer
of 1941. Running factories for 3 series ends by November, 1938
(depending on your slider moves); while a 4 series run ends October,
1939; and a 5 series run will end in October 1940. The USSR can support
a maximum effective IC of 550 with its native resources. But you will
have built up a reserve of raw materials that with proper trading could
enable you to have an effective IC of 1000.

The use of IC towards upgrades is most effective as your technology
increases, since upgrading units from 1918 infantry directly to 1941
infantry, for example, is much cheaper than doing the upgrade from 1918
to 1936 to 1939 to 1941. Also, dissent will come again during the great
purge, and is best paid down after the Hawk (reduced dissent) and
Interventionism (reduced demand for consumer goods) sliders are working
to your maximum advantage. It is essential to get rid of all dissent
before war with Germany, and is easily achievable before event the
Winter War.

##  Military 

The key to the Soviet military is industry. The Soviet Union can produce
a large amount of Tanks and motorized infantry and. These units make it
possible to win quickly against Germany. Head Quarters (HQ) will soon
become a key to Soviet success in conducting counter-attacks. A key
tactical point is to change the Soviet military doctrines for Spearhead
which makes it easier to win the game.

Air support is used by more advanced players to decimate the German
forces more quickly, primarily with CAS and TAC.

###  Early Annexations 

Generally, the Soviet player has no need to create early wars, and very
little to gain, from early annexations. Generally, the small IC gain
(about 2 total IC gain) plus the dissent caused by a declaration of war
does not make these wars a wise/efficient decision. SOV also have very
low Ground Defence Efficiency \[see below\] which means much higher
casualties in any early wars.

###  The Great Officer Purge 

In March, 1938, the event "The Great Officer Purge" fires. It is one of
the most punitive events in the entire game, and is certainly the worst
event that happens to the Soviet Union. You have two options:

-   Purge the Traitors: Gain 10% dissent, lose 10 manpower and 170
    military leaders. 60 historical leaders will be killed, *in addition
    to* 110 randomly selected leaders. Additionally, lose six ministers
    and two technology teams.
-   No need for Brutality: Gain 30% dissent, Hawk sliders move 2 towards
    Dove.

Purging the officers is typically seen as the most beneficial strategy
for the following reasons:

-   The Soviet Union has a very large number of leaders
-   The extra 20% dissent penalty from "no need for brutality" has a
    significantly negative economic affect
-   The two moves to Dove from "no need for brutality" erase the 10%
    production bonus, and reduce dissent growth to -2% (from -6%) and
    manpower growth to just 2% (from 6%). Additionally, if you purge,
    the Soviet Union only needs one slider move (in 1936) towards Hawk.
    The rest can be done via events (mostly Soviet influence in China)
    and via Guarantees of Independence in Europe. Standing army means
    more organization and cheaper upgrades: By 1941 you can have 12 more
    organization with upgrades at 25% (from the army slider) instead of
    50%. The net effect is 50% vs 75% including the Central Planning
    effects).

Some players advocate for saving the officers for the following reasons:

-   Roleplaying a more benevolent USSR
-   Saving historical leaders (such as Zhukov) that may have be randomly
    purged by the event
-   Using a Soviet strategy that is \*not\* manpower/attrition focused,
    and could benefit from stronger leaders
-   Tech team Alksnis, level 6, is the only team that can research air
    doctrines until 1940
-   Tech team Tukhachevsky, level 5, is better than Shaposhnikov
-   Minister Berzin, Head of Intelligence, is the only minister who
    provides a 5% research bonus
-   Minister Alksnis, Chief of Air Force, is the only minister who
    provides bonuses for fighters and interceptors.

###  Soviet Ground Defense Efficiency 

[Red Army soldiers in
Stalingrad](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Sov-stalingrad.jpg "File:Sov-stalingrad.jpg")

####  In Hearts of Iron 2 

In order to simulate the ineffectiveness of Soviet defenses before the
war with Germany, the Soviet Union has significant defensive penalties
for its military that cannot be adjusted in-game by the player. The GDE
(Ground Defense Efficiency) score is essentially a percentage of the
effectiveness of your units on defense. Thus, a GDE of 0.2 means 20%
effective, or put another way, fighting at an 80% penalty when on the
defense. The normal value of GDE for other nations is 0.8: due to all
the advantages defenders have in the game, GDE never rises above 0.8.

-   The Soviet Union starts with 0.2 GDE.
-   It increases by 0.1 in May 1940 and later years for a total of +0.4.
-   When anyone DOWs you get all these future increases plus an
    additional 0.1 are received.
-   When Finns offer you peace through the event you get +0.1 (note this
    is the event not any other offer of peace).
-   Grand total gets you back to 0.8.
-   AI gets +0.6 at the start instead of the above events EXCEPT that
    they still get the Winter War event allowing the AI to get 0.9 GDE.

Timeline of GDE values:

-   Prior to Dec 12th, 1939, your GDE should be 0.2
-   From Dec 12th, 1939 to May 1st, 1940, it should be 0.3
-   From May 2nd, 1940 to May 1st, 1941, it should be 0.4
-   From May 2nd, 1941 to May 1st, 1942, it should be 0.5
-   From May 2nd, 1942 to May 1st, 1943, it should be 0.6
-   From May 2nd, 1943 to May 1st, 1944, it should be 0.7
-   From May 2nd, 1944 on, it should be 0.8

Being attacked by a major power (eg: Germany) will automatically boost
your GDE up to 0.7 (after a random delay of a few weeks to as much as
several months)... but ONLY if they attack you, not vice versa; and the
last boost (from 0.7 to 0.8 GDE) only happens in 1944, regardless. Note
that all of this applies ONLY to a Human-controlled Russia... an
AI-controlled Russia has a GDE of 0.8 right from January 1936 on.

Details are available in [this
thread](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=201702) .

####  In Doomsday or Armageddon 

There is a different event chain in Doomsday and Armageddon. One
important difference is that the Finnish Winter War has no effect on the
GDE. The Winter War is fought at 0.4 GDE. Then there are two GDE gearing
up events in January 1940 and June 1940, raising GDE to 0.5 and then 0.6
GDE. In June ´41 the GDE gets the last but one raise to 0.7 GDE. The
last raise to 0.8 GDE depends on whether the Soviet Union is human or AI
controlled. The AI gets maximum GDE when they lost 10% of their
provinces in the "Great Patriotic War" event. A human controlled Soviet
Union gets the same event when it is under attack (!), lost 5% of its
territory and lost one major western city OR by June ´42 at the latest.

###  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 

-   No Deal with the Enemies of the Workers: This option does not
    provide any benefits to the player.
-   Accept the pact: You will receive many free territory claims as well
    as a free slider move towards Interventionism.
-   Propose an alliance with Germany: If it is accepted, the USSR will
    be in the Axis. It will lead to a bizarre game where fascists and
    communists are allied together to defeat democracy.

####  Historic Molotov Ribbentrop national provinces: 

It is not necessary to declare war on the Baltic States (Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia) if SOV get the historic Moltov Ribbentrop treaty.
Beginning on May 17, 1940, the USSR will have a 20% chance of
successfully demanding territory (in the Diplomacy screen) to annex the
Baltic States. Historically the Baltic states folded in stages in spring
and summer 1940. You can also use the acceptall diplomatic cheat to
simulate the historic events. Romania should also give up three
Bessarabian provinces via the Pact on 27 JUN 1940.

###  The Winter War 

[KV-2 heavy
tank](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=KW-2.jpg "File:KW-2.jpg")

Assuming [Poland](/Poland "Poland") has been annexed by Germany, a
historical event fires in November 1939. The event gives you an option
to give an ultimatumn to Finland, demanding two border provinces near
Leningrad (Viipuri and Sortavala). AI Finland refuses to cede over the
provinces 99% of the time, triggering a war. It is generally best to
press claims as Stalin did historically since refusing to demand the
provinces changes your Interventionism value by -1.

If you plan to choose the "Press claims" option and therefore almost
certainly start the war, it's best that you prepare for the conflict
before it breaks out, during the summer months of 1939. Remember to
concentrate your army near the Finnish border in time. Also if you
haven't upgraded your divisions by now prioritize the divisions you're
planning to use for the war and move the upgrade slider just enough to
turn their equipment more lethal.

####  The quick way to win 

Send most of your mobile troops to the Finnish border around june of
1939, including your starting 10 Motorized Divisions and 4 tank
divisions. Use these 14 divisions as your main strike force: split them
up into 2 motorized and one tank division. Deploy close to 30 infantry
divisions close to the Finnish border and have at least one 11 division
plus the one "Stavka" the hq unit in one big army under a Field Marshal.
To win quickly in less than a month attack the middle of Finland and do
NOT attack the fortified areas, you only need to take a few of the
middle provinces cutting Finland in half and then a screen will pop up
where you can get what you originally asked for or take the whole of
Finland.

There is an interesting alternative approach: build 2+ transports and
make landing on Finnish costal provinces (including Turku and Vaasa) and
send one huge juggernout to Viipuri-Helsinki. You don't need Marines
because there is no defense usually. If things go well, you'll annex
Finland in 7 days without diplomatic penalty before peace event fires.

####  The end of the Finnish Winter War 

Once you've taken Helsinki or approximately four Finnish provinces,
event \#2627 will fire. You'll get a chance to re-state your ultimatumn,
which this time will be accepted 99% of the time, or continue the war in
hopes of annexation ("Let's bring them Socialism!").

This time deciding which option is the best one is a bit more debatable.
Settling for two provinces bordering Leningrad means that you'll have to
divert your attention (and around 20-30 divisions) to the northern front
once Operation Barbarossa starts, while going for the annexation shoots
up not only your Interventionism (by 1) but your belligerence as well,
and immediately ends any existing non-aggression pacts with Germany,
France, Great Britain and USA. Both selections also have their positive
effects: Settling for two provinces lowers your dissent value by an
impressive 10 (altough there's a 1% chance it goes up by 5), and
annexation means you get the IC's and resources of Finland. If your
dissent is over 10%, then it's a no-brainer to settle what you asked
for. But otherwise it's up to you.

##  War with Germany 

Everything the USSR player does should be directed towards the ultimate
war in Germany, which will usually begin around June 22, 1941. The
player should ensure that all dissent is gone, and all upgrades are
complete before June, 1941. At the beginning of the war, an event will
ask regarding the movement of industry to Siberia. There is no reason
not to accept this event, as it greatly helps the USSR.

  

##  The really quick way to win 

To win quickly against Germany all you need to do is this

-   In 1936 change the doctrine from Soviet land Doctrine to Spearhead

&nbsp;

-   Make sure to build industry all the way up to Feb 1940

&nbsp;

-   In Feb 1940 start to build Motorized infantry and tank divisions.

&nbsp;

-   When Germany Is in France, but before France, has fallen attack
    Germany or Romania, Romania can be a better choice since then
    Germany will Declare war upon you.

By doing these 4 things you are guaranteed to win before the end of 1940
despite the fact that your Gde is very gimped.

What you need to do is to have 2 motorized divisions for every 1 tank
division and each one under a skilled Major General, and for every 12
divisions place a field marshal.

Research tactical bomber and fighter technologies since you already have
some built, and upgrades those before you attack.

By correctly attacking and using your air power you can win over Germany
in late 1940.

###    Force Deployment & Tactics 

If you choose not to attack in 1940 but want to wait for the Axis to
attack you then you should build up your industry all the way until
summer 1940.

By starting on building up industry in 1936 preferably to the east of
Moscow so that it is hard to get to by enemy forces, and using ALL
available IC to build industry. Make sure to asign all divisions under
logistical wizards so that they consume as little goods as possible and
do not reinforce them until you need them.

Only reinforce those units you are going to use in the winter war and
only upgrade those and do it at during the summer of 39.

Make sure that you have researched the spearhead doctrine since it is
several times better then the games “soviet land doctrine”, doctrine.
And the point is to win as quickly and as easily as possible.

If you do this and do it properly then by the Summer of 1940 you should
have an effective IC anywhere from 650-850 depending on how well you
trade and what slider options you have chosen.

During the summer of 1940 start by building tanks and motorized
divisions and tactical fighters and headquarters. When the war comes in
1941 you will have a large motorized army which can easily destroy the
attacking axis within a few month and you never need to lose a single
province.

  

###  Winning the Easy Way with the Soviet land Doctrine 

The Soviet Union is extremely powerful, and beating Germany is quite
easy using the correct approach. Two simple steps, also known as
"spamming industry & infantry", will ensure an easy victory:

-   3 rounds of using all IC for factory building
-   Then, massive parallel serialized builds of infantry (though taking
    care to pay down all dissent, upgrades, and reinforcements): 400-500
    infantry by the time of Barbarrosa is a good figure. Combined with
    Milita, and the USSR can easily attain 600+ army units.

Using this method, it is possible to never surrender a single province
to Germany, and to essentially go on the offensive at the very beginning
of the war. In fact, if done with careful effeciency, the Soviet
military will be so strong and so overpowering that the German AI,
knowing how massive the Soviet army is, will not dare declare war! If a
Soviet game goes into the summer of 1942 without a German declaration of
war, it means the Soviet player has created a massive military that will
steam roll Germany all the way to Berlin and beyond. :)

##  Alternative War Options 

###  War with China 

For the expansive player who likes to conquer everything in sight, an
oft neglected direction is China in 1936. Why China? It's a large land
mass that no one in the west is going to go to war with you over. I
generally do not like to share with anyone so I personally often find
ways to eliminate or isolate Mongolia from the war effort, but that's of
minor importance. Their are two main ways to enter China. Either you can
smash through Japan and her puppet Manchouko, which will bring you into
war with Japan as well which you probably don't want.

Or you can skip war with Japan all together by invading through
Sinkiang. The main problem here is that invading through Sinkiang means
crossing those damn mountains and that can take 6 months to a year, if
not more. Additionally you should either have conquered Mongolia (puppet
state of USSR I know, but still) or moved troops their so they can
invade Shanxi. Main reason? Keeping the Japanese out.

The two times I've done it, Japan did not go to war with China, but I
don't guarantee that they won't, however, you don't have to go war with
them. If that happens you'll be in a race with Japan to capture all the
territory you can.

It is a tough war though, and winter 37 is going to be very tough.
Generally going through a careful step by step invasion process pushing
for the pacific, you can be done with war in China by late 1938
(including all warlord states) no later than may of 39, so you can still
have all your army back in Europe just in time for the winter war.
You'll have the advantage of going into the winter war, and then world
war 2 with the most experienced army in the whole game. In fact, I'd
recommend that any units left behind in China be newer units so you can
fully benefit from that edge.

From this point on, the war in the game should play out as mentioned in
the war with Germany section, other than the advantage you'll get in
additional manpower, resources, and IC, but of course, you're not going
to war with China because you need something. You're doing it because it
seemed like a fun idea, (at least in my case)

Additionally, if you're looking for war with england, you'll suddenly
find yourself in perfect location for a two pronged strike into India.
However if you do this, you still need to keep a strong army at the
polish (and later german) border because Germany will declare war on you
no matter what you're doing to England.

##  Multiplayer Suggestions 

In a Multiplayer game, Germany is the most serious enemy of the Soviet
Union, and will typically force Barbarrosa in May, 1940. Germany will be
technically superior to the Soviet Union in every way at this time, and
may even have more industrial capacity. Wise German adversaries will
focus on land doctrines, infantry, armor, and air superiority. All
German units, especially in 1940, will be a level more advanced than
Soviet units.

To win easily in Multilayer as the USSR if you start in the 1936
scenario change to Spearhead doctrine, Build industry for 2-3 rounds and
then build motorized units and tanks and combine them in 1 tank 2
motorized groups each specific division under s killed Major General and
of course 1 Field Marshal for every 12 Divisions that you have
