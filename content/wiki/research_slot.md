A research slot is the number of teams a nation may have actively
researching at any given time. A nation will get one tech slot for free.
It will gain one extra research slot for every 20 base [Industrial
Capacity](/Industrial_Capacity "Industrial Capacity") they currently
possess, up to a maximum number of 5 research slots. In other words, if
your Industrial Capacity is \>= 80, you will have the maximum number of
slots available.

More information on research can be found on the
