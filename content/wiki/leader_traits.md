Generals can have distinct traits that offer various benefits on the
units he commands.

The bitvalue is used for modding and is contained in the
leaders\country.csv file. It used used to flag which traits a leader
has. If a leader has multiple traits, simply add the bitvalues together.
For example, if a leader has both winter specialist and panzer leader
traits, the value would be 136 (8+128).

It is possible to modify leaders names to include details of their
traits so a sort on names brings all of a type together.

##  Land Unit Leader Traits 

###  Logistics Wizard 

Reduces fuel and supply consumption of non-moving units commanded by a
leader with this trait (by -25%).

Bitvalue: 1

###  Defensive Doctrine 

Increases defensive effectiveness of units commanded by a leader with
this trait (by +10%).

Bitvalue: 2

###  Offensive Doctrine 

Increases offensive effectiveness of units commanded by a leader with
this trait (by +10%).

Bitvalue: 4

###  Winter Specialist 

Increases the effectiveness of troops fighting in snow by +25% and
Frozen terrain by +20%.

Bitvalue: 8

###  Trickster 

The effects of this trait are, well... somewhat tricky: It **increases**
the chance that the combat event Surprise will occur, on offense as well
as on defense. This chance is **further** influenced by how advanced
your own industrial research of Encryption and Decryption (E&D)
technologies is relative to your opponent. Exact figures, however,
apparently are unknown (at least for HoI2 version 1.2). I also do not
know whether **Skill Level** of the Trickster leader is having an
influence on the probability of a Surprise occurring.

When a successful Surprise has occured, combat efficiency of the
opposing forces is reduced by 20% and it will read "Surprise" in their
combat details pane. From gaming experience it has been my observation
that Surprise is a rare event (in HoI2 version 1.2), probably not more
than once in 20 battles, even with E&D fully researched.

A Trickster will also hide the exact **division strength** of his
formation. In practical terms this means that when playing with counters
on, the opponent will keep guessing whether there are 2 or 3 divisions
in a "XXX" formation, and will never know how many there are in a "XXXX"
formation (although four divisions is the minimum for "XXXX", while "XX"
obviously is always one division only).

Bitvalue: 16

HoI2 forums)

#  Hearts Of Iron II - Doomsday 

There are some differences. The terrain traits add 10% efficiency to
that type of terrain which also results in a speed bonus for that
terrain. You need to contrast the same kind of units under leaders with
or with the trait to see the differences. Inf under a normal leader
might have 93% efficiency in a battle in hill terrain, but the same
units under a hills fighter could have 102% efficiency.

Another major difference to Hears of Iron II is that leader traits are
ignored if land/air/naval units are over their leader's command limit.
Thus a land unit with two Infantry divisions commanded by a Major
General with Logistic Wizard and Offensive Doctrine as trait will not
see a reduction in oil/supply consumption nor will it receive a combat
bonus if in combat.
