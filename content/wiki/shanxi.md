##  Overview 

Shanxi is a minor power, a warlord state controlling the north of China,
bordering Communist and Nationalist China, Japan, Mongolia and Xibei San
Ma. Thus it is threatened on almost all sides. However one's main
concern is the looming Japanese invasion. Playing as Shanxi is no more
than a pure fight for survival, and defence is your number one priority.

##  Technology 

Shanxi is awful for technology. There is only one team and one slot. The
best thing to do is to research land doctrine, following Mobility Focus
Doctrine through to Blitzkrieg. This ensures a high Organisation for
defence against Japan.

##  Diplomacy 

Shanxi is friendly with all Chinese nations bar the Communists and thus
a chance of joining the Nationalists and Xibei is very high. However the
Japanese and Manchukuo are not your friends and they will be your
nemesis throughout the game.

##  Sliders 

With a fairly small IC of around 10 you must try to reach Central
Planning as soon as possible to attain your 25% IC increase.

##  Economy 

###  Trading 

Shanxi will need to use its money or supplies to pay for natural
resources, which are fairly scarce. Alliance with Nationalist China will
result in handouts.

###  Industrial Production 

As before, you must have a high production of either supplies or
consumer goods. Remember to not let dissent get over 3.50% or you will
start losing precious IC.

##  Military 

###  Army 

Militia is the key to Shanxi military development, they are cheap and
quick to build. Continue to build on your already fairly large army with
militia and infantry to ensure safety when the Japanese DOW you. You
should be able to survive with about 30 divisions.

###  Navy 

You have no navy and should have no interest in getting one.

###  Air Force 

There is no need for an air force. Ally with Nationalist China and let
their planes do the work.

##  Walkthrough 

Straight from the off you must move all your troops to the Japanese
border. Pay particular attention to the provinces of Jining and Tianjin,
where the Japanese could make a breakthrough. AFTER the end of the
Communist/Nationalist war, if they have not formed a united front you
should join Xibei and Nationalist China in an alliance. Continue steady
military growth until Japan DOWs you and your allies. Remember that you
are the first line of Chinese defense and that the Nationalists would
rather annex you than help you, thus victory over Japan is paramount.
Take the Japanese provinces first and wait before launching an attack on
Manchukuo to ensure that you regain organization and strength. If you
push too much the Japanese will soon push you all the way back and more.
Annex Manchukuo and sue for peace with Japan, allowing them a route
through to the Nationalists. Then turn on your allies and sweep through
Xibei before holding firm against the Nationalists, waiting for the
Japanese to destroy them and grabbing as much IC as possible. After that
you are free to do what you want, but Yunnan, Sinkiang and Tibet are the
obvious targets. Do not attempt to take on the Communists, who have
superior armies.
