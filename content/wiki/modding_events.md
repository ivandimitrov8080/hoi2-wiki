If combat is the heart of the game, and the AI is the brain, events are
the skeleton that holds the whole thing together, and sets stage for the
coming World War. Users can modify these events or create new ones to
bring an entirely new flavor to the game or just tailor it to their own
personal tastes.

Event files are contained in the db/events folder.

Listed below are some guides, cheat sheets, and examples for editing
these event files within the game.
