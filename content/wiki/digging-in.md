title: "Digging In"
---

**Digging-in** represents the establishment of defensive structures by a
stationary land unit in preparation for an attack. These preparations
allow the defending army to withstand a stronger attack from an opposing
force. Hearts of Iron II represents these preparations as a **dug-in
modifier** . Units at war and without moving orders will add to their
dug-in modifier daily. Digging in is automatic but only happens when you
are at war.

#  Combat Effects 

Units with a dug-in combat modifier will have an additional bonus to
their defense effectiveness versus enemy air and land units. Dug in
status can increase up to 20 and increases about 1 per day. Each dug in
level is worth 1 combat modifier meaning that defenders can get a
maximum +20 combat modifier in land combat. This modifier can be
substantial against attacking air units, making any damage incurred by
the defending units as almost negligible.
