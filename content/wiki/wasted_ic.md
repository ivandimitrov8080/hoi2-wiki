Wasted [Industrial Capacity](/Industrial_Capacity "Industrial Capacity")
represents the amount of IC you have allocated over the actual amounted
needed for the [Production
Slider](/Production_Slider "Production Slider") , [Reinforcements
Slider](/index.php?title=Reinforcements_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Reinforcements Slider (page does not exist)")
, and [Upgrades
Slider](/index.php?title=Upgrades_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Upgrades Slider (page does not exist)")
. For example, if your production queue requires 100 IC to run at full
capacity, and you have allocated 103 IC with the Production Slider, you
will have 3 Wasted IC.

Allocating amounts over that needed in the [Consumer Goods
Slider](/Consumer_Goods_Slider "Consumer Goods Slider") and [Supplies
Slider](/index.php?title=Supplies_Slider&action=edit&redlink=1 "Supplies Slider (page does not exist)")
results in gaining extra money or supplies. These IC are not considered
wasted.

You may always see the amount of wasted IC you have at the upper right
corner of the screen.
