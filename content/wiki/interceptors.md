title: "Interceptors"
---

Interceptors are short-range fighters designed to destroy enemy bombers.
They have high speed and good manouverability to make them agile enough
to evade the machine guns of the bombers, while having the firepower
needed to disable a heavy, armoured bomber. Against enemy fighters, they
are less effective yet they still put up a good fight.
