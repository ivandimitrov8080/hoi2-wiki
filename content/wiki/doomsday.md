***Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday*** is a stand-alone expansion for the
game of World War II strategy, *[Hearts of Iron II](/HoI2 "HoI2")* ,
released in April 4, 2006. It contains everything that was in the
original game while highlighting and expanding the period after
historical World War II, including a hypothetical [nuclear
war](/Nuclear_Weapons "Nuclear Weapons") between the Soviet Union and
the Allies.

##  Intelligence folder 

There is a new intelligence sub-game for spies. This provides
information on other countries and allows operations against them such
as:

-   Steal Technology Blueprints
-   Sabotage Production
-   Assassinate ministers and leaders
-   Spread propaganda
-   Talk to the mass media
-   Sabotage infrastructure
-   Fund partisans
-   Coup

##  Other changes 

Doomsday also features some other changes and additions such as:

-   Additional graphics such as bomber sprites
-   Escort Carriers (CVL)
-   Hospital technology tree that recover manpower losses
-   A "do not upgrade" button for divisions (much requested by fans)
-   The option of automating the production sliders (much requested by
    fans)
-   Submarines have separate stats for convoy raiding and naval combat
-   An extended timeframe - the game end date has been changed to 1953
-   New technologies to bring the game into the cold war era
-   An included scenario editor
-   The ability to trade divisions between nations
-   Minister and tech effects such as small arms assembly apply to
    existing serial runs. You no longer have to restart serial runs to
    get the benefits.
-   Factory and other province improvements \[forts\] production times
    finish on the same day regardless of any infrastructure differences.
-   The upgrade portion of the Army slider was changed. Upgrade cost and
    time is cut in half. In HOI2 it was 10 to 100 in increments of 10
    while in Doomsday it's 5 to 50 in increments of 5.
