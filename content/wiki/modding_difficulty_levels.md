Open the file /db/difficuly.csv and change the values which you want.

The first line VERYEASY;EASY;NORMAL;HARD;VERYHARD is just a comment, so
no point in changing that. The next 2 sections are the ones that matter,
subsequent sections are not used. The numbers are percentage
penalties/bonuses for each setting

I find that the difference between the difficulty levels is too big so I
create 2 new levels  
1) half way between Normal and Hard  
2) half way between Hard and VeryHard  
and delete the 2 easy levels which I never want.

Since VERYEASY;EASY;NORMAL;HARD;VERYHARD will always be the options
displayed when creating a new game, you have to remember which option
corresponds to which difficulty level.

I do not have the original settings any more as I use StonyRoad which I
think modified the settings, so for StonyRoad I use the following
