##  Introduction 

The Community Database Cleanup Project (CDCP) is a mod which sole
purpose is to fix all the mistakes, typoes, errors and other such
"small" issues in HOI2-DDA which are solvable by modding files. This is
the closest thing the HOI2 community has to an "unofficial" patch. This
mod has since incorporated into the 1.3 patch so there is no need to
download it.

##  Features 

CDCP is a specialized mod intended to simply fix minor game errors. As
such, the mod should be fully compatible with all other mods as long as
you install CDCP before anything else. Installing CDCP before installing
major mods like TRP or CORE, will however be waste of time. These mods
changes more or less everything, in doing so they remove all changes
made by CDCP.
