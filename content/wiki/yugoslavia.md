##  Background 

Pros:

1.  Generous manpower pool and an exceptional manpower growth rate for a
    minor, enough for supporting your country into major status.
    Shortage of manpower is the downfall of many other minors.
2.  Easy to max out central planning, meaning a small amount of IC can
    turn into a large amount of IC.
3.  Proximity to other countries means the possibility for lightning
    fast conquests and great prospects
4.  Generous starting army, although they are outdated and depleted.
5.  Access to the Mediterranean sea, making an invasion of Africa and
    the Middle East possible.
6.  OK tech teams, and by the time you annex your neighbors, you will
    have a powerful and well rounded mix of teams.
7.  Decent ministers, the manpower chief of staff especially is useful
    for Yugoslavia moreso than a typical 20% org regain minister would
    be.

  
Cons:

1.  Horrid generals, but by the time you get done with Italy, you will
    have an experienced officer corps
2.  Outdated and worthless starting air force and navy
3.  No transports
4.  No merchant marine
5.  Dependent on supply trades to maintain resource levels until she
    expands
6.  Proximity to other countries and a tangled web of guarantees of
    independence means you will have to fight on multiple fronts during
    any war you choose to partake in, and will have to fight delaying
    actions within your own country while your offensive forces fight
    elsewhere.
7.  In the latest DD/ARMA patch, you will have to devote the majority of
    your money to the intelligence system or be smothered by foreign
    meddling - this disables your ability to use the diplomacy system.

##  Strategy 

1.  The key to Yugoslavian supremacy is to conquer the dominions of
    Italy, this will propel you into major power status.
2.  Disband your fleet, it is worthless. Set your air force to not
    reinforce or upgrade.
3.  Start the game and build 4 IC, put all your divisions under logistic
    generals.
4.  Move your sliders to central planning, when you can no longer move
    to central planning, move to authoritarian, then move to central
    planning again, by 1940 you should have +25% IC from central
    planning.
5.  Technologies: Modern infantry, mountain divisions, cavalry, but most
    importantly: machine tools, agriculture, ground doctrines, rear area
    dumps.
6.  Make sure you have the manpower chief of staff, and that you remove
    the -IC% minister ASAP.
7.  The first 3 IC will finish first, you won't have enough IC to finish
    the fourth on time.
8.  When the 3 IC finish, let your army reinforce and upgrade.
9.  Trade supplies for energy/metal/rares from Germany if need be.
10. When this is finished, 2 serials of unbrigaded infantry, 1 serial of
    unbrigaded mountain troops, when the last IC finishes, 1 more serial
    of unbrigaded infantry and leave the rest IC for
    upgrades/reinforcements.
11. By Anschluss of Austria you should have at least 35 modern,
    reinforced divisions, enough to surprise Italy with an attack.
12. DO NOT DECLARE WAR ON ITALY DIRECTLY - Germany will likely declare
    war on you in retaliation. Instead, declare war on defenseless
    Albania, after making sure all but 1 of your divisions is on the
    Italian border. You will be able to annex Albania within 2 weeks -
    and meanwhile, Italy will declare war on you because it guaranteed
    the independence of Albania.
13. Invade Italy, they should be caught completely by surprise since up
    until that point you had good relations. They will begin to rush
    reinforcements from Africa. Before the reinforcements arrive you
    should have Genoa/Turin pocketed and have a firm defensive line at
    La Spezia.
14. When you approach 30-40 manpower (for me it was when I had \~45
    divisions), stop building units and build a few transports and at
    least 3 parallel runs of convoys (these will be used to invade north
    Africa and eastern Africa). The remaining manpower will be used to
    reinforce losses and build the occasional unit.
15. Slowly push Italy into the boot, you will most likely not be able to
    encircle them and will push a battered army group into Sicily. Cross
    into Sicily by foot and wipe them out.
16. The Italian colonies should be COMPLETELY EMPTY - send a few
    divisions to capture the victory points there.
17. Once Italy is annexed, you should have about 73 IC and a new
    resource stockpile. Your biggest problem, which has probably become
    obvious to you, is a lack of manpower. From this point on, we are
    only going to build infantry when it is commandos (namely mountain),
    and even then, in small quantities. Build tanks from this point on,
    although you might not be up to tech until 1941. Tanks cost less
    manpower, and give you more bang for your buck. Do only build modern
    medium tanks, ancient tanks and light tanks are a waste of time and
    will take a substantial amount of time to upgrade.
18. I recommend making Libya and Somalia as puppets, they will augment
    your army with more infantry, and if you can deal with losing 1-2
    IC, then also release Ethiopia. By the end of the year they will
    have 6+ divisions each, and if you released them with central
    planning all the way to the right, they should have 8-9 IC, not bad.
    If you notice your puppet countries' IC going down, make sure you
    supply them with rare materials, energy and metal, if need be. Even
    a small deficit can cripple a puppet nation and take away several
    IC.
19. Do not bother making military police/garrisons for Italy, it might
    seem tempting, but you would need a dozen or more garrisons to
    suppress the partisan revolt risk, and you simply don't have the
    manpower to do this.
20. Yugoslavia has now come into its own, but you are still missing
    several things to flesh out into a major power: an airforce,
    maneuver forces (tanks) and a navy. Focus on this now, especially
    the first two. 2-3 groups of interceptors should be enough to ensure
    local air superiority, while 1-2 groups of tactical bombers will
    prove to be extremely useful for operational elasticity. Most
    importantly, you need at least 2 corps (3 division armies) of tanks,
    preferably 3. These units will use up much less manpower to make
    than the infantry we were spamming previously and hence their
    manufacture will be orderly.
21. At this point, several major options are open to you. Joining the
    allies, you would open a second front against the Germans, which may
    result in the offensive against the low countries and France
    grinding to a halt. The underbelly of the Reich will be exposed and
    little will stand between you and Berlin. Alternatively, if for some
    reason your previous campaigns dragged past spring of 1940, and
    western Europe has already been invaded, joining the Axis would also
    offer an interesting option: a surprise attack across Africa would
    result in an immediate victory and the capture of the Suez, the
    eventual seizure of the Middle Eastern oil fields, while you could
    also augment the german Army Group South in its offensive against
    Stalingrad and Baku. If you don't want to make a major decision like
    this now, you could invade Hungary to gain some more IC - chances
    are, they didn't join the Axis and that the guarantee of
    independence on them is no more.
22. Tip: Do not attack Germany 1v1 - while you might think you could
    pull it off because most of your units are 2-3 stars now and your
    generals have gone from 1 skill to 4-5, it won't make up for
    Germany's numerical advantage, air superiority and doctrinal
    superiority. I would only recommend engaging Germany if the Western
    front is still intact or you are willing to military control your
    allies and bring reinforcements to your theater. If Germany seems
    impossible to take down, just join the Axis, you are fascist anyway
    and you wont need +200 relations to get a decent chance of joining
    up.
23. Tip: When you declare war on Germany, you will likely be attacked by
    Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. My recommendation is to form a
    defensive line along the Austrian border, and Romania-Hungary, and
    devote the rest of your divisions to invading Bulgaria. You will
    have to give up Novisad and other provinces north of the Danube - it
    will be impossible to defend them. Consider military controlling
    some minor allies to help bolster your defensive line - Iraq is
    especially useful. It will probably be a 1:1 fight in Bulgaria
    (that's all you can spare and not have the rest of your country be
    over-run), but your experienced and modern troops will overpower the
    Bulgarians. It may seem like you are in a world of trouble, but if
    you can manage to annex Bulgaria, you will win the war.

##    Axis or no Axis? 

Entering the axis can be worthwhile, especially if you control Bulgaria
and Albania. When you enter, you will receive the coup event. Ignore it
and do not violate the pact of steel. Note that it'll get you a total of
20 dissent, or a DoW from Germany if you decide to break the pact.

Other option is to join the Comintern (The Allies are probably the worst
choice, since they can't help you much). Joining the Comintern, SU might
be able to help you by sending troops in your territory, plus you don't
need to garrison a SU border you might have, freeing most (if not all)
of your forces to fight Germany. Do this if you want more of a
challenge.

    up.
23. Tip: When you declare war on Germany, you will likely be attacked by
    Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. My recommendation is to form a
    defensive line along the Austrian border, and Romania-Hungary, and
    devote the rest of your divisions to invading Bulgaria. You will
    have to give up Novisad and other provinces north of the Danube - it
    will be impossible to defend them. Consider military controlling
    some minor allies to help bolster your defensive line - Iraq is
    especially useful. It will probably be a 1:1 fight in Bulgaria
    (that's all you can spare and not have the rest of your country be
    over-run), but your experienced and modern troops will overpower the
    Bulgarians. It may seem like you are in a world of trouble, but if
    you can manage to annex Bulgaria, you will win the war.

##    Axis or no Axis? 

Entering the axis can be worthwhile, especially if you control Bulgaria
and Albania. When you enter, you will receive the coup event. Ignore it
and do not violate the pact of steel. Note that it'll get you a total of
20 dissent, or a DoW from Germany if you decide to break the pact.

Other option is to join the Comintern (The Allies are probably the worst
choice, since they can't help you much). Joining the Comintern, SU might
be able to help you by sending troops in your territory, plus you don't
need to garrison a SU border you might have, freeing most (if not all)
of your forces to fight Germany. Do this if you want more of a
challenge.
