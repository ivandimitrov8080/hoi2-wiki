##  Introduction 

Based on the Harry Turtledove novels, players unfamiliar with those
novels may well enjoy this mod anyway. Consider a world where the
Confederate States of America still exists and with their British and
French allies lost WW1 to the powers of the German Empire and the United
States. It is now 1936 and war looms again. The Entente powers have
swung towards extremist governments, the USA and Germany have become
complacent and the Communist forces never took power in Russia; in the
pacific the Japanese are still hungry for more territory...
