##  Strategy for Finland 

Finland can be a refreshing change, playing in a minor and support role
of a big operation. You won't be able to do anything major, and if you
want that, Germany is probably a better choice.

First order of business is re-taking the territories lost in the Winter
War. After that, leave a suitable garrisson in Vipurii, and try to
attack Leningrad if at all possible. You should be using the northern
troops, especially the German ones to take Murmansk and the nearby
territories. With some nice deployment, you should be able to encircle
some Russian divisions at Kola. Afterwards, once the Germans reach
Leningrad (they do most of the time), you can help them attack it.

Unfortunately, most of the time, the scenario ends with a marginal
victory for the SU, if you aren't playing Germany.
