Developed by mehmet12 and miihkali, this mod focuses on an alternate
reality in which Greece won the Greco-Turkish War of 1922 and then went
on to fragment Anatolia. Greece, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Kurdistan,
and Turkey are all playable with new ministers, leaders and skins.
Version 1.0 released in December 2007- the next version is said to
include more modded nations such as Kalmykia, Jebel Al Druze, Maronite
Lebanon, Coptic Egypt, Circassia, Crimean Tatar Republic, and the Kazan
and Don Cossack Hosts.
