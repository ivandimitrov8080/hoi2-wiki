From my look at the models.csv file, it gives the country-specific model
names- such as ship classes. Unfortunately, many countries don't have
all the names. Each line starts out with code: for example
MODEL_GER_12_1. GER is the country code. 12 gives the unit- in this case
it's a fighter. 1 is the model- here it's model 1, Early Fighter.
Afterwards come the names in different languages. The unit codes are as
follows:

-   0= Infantry
-   1= Cavalry
-   2= Mot. Infantry
-   3= Mec. Infantry
-   4= L Arm
-   5= Arm
-   6= Airborne
-   7= Marines
-   8= Mountain
-   9= Garrison
-   10= HQ
-   11= Militia
-   12 = Int F
-   13 = Ftr
-   14 = Strat
-   15 = Tac
-   16 = Nav
-   17 = CAS
-   18 = Air Transport
-   19 = Flying Bomb
-   20 = Rocket
-   21 = BB
-   22 = CL
-   23 = CA
-   24 = BC
-   25 = DD
-   26 = CV
-   27 = CVL
-   28 = SS
-   29 = SSN
-   30 = TP

Note: Rocket model_0 is flying rocket, model_1 is ballistic missile and
model_2 is ICBM

Brigades also have unit codes like this: BRIG_MODEL_X\_Y Unit codes (X)
are:

-   1= Art
-   2 = SP-ART
-   3 = Rocket Art
-   4 = SP Rocket
-   5 = AT
-   6 = Tank Destroyer
-   7 = Light Tank
-   8 = Heavy Tank
-   9 = Super-heavy Tank
-   10 = Armoured Car
-   11 = AA
-   12 = Police
-   13 = Engineer
-   14 = CAG
-   15 = Escort Fighter
-   16 = naval_asw
-   17 = naval_anti_air_s
-   18 = naval_radar_s
-   19 = naval_fire_controll_s
-   20 = naval_improved_hull_s
-   21 = naval_torpedoes_s
-   22 = naval_anti_air_l
-   23 = naval_radar_l
-   24 = naval_fire_controll_l
-   25 = naval_improved_hull_l
-   26 = naval_torpedoes_l
