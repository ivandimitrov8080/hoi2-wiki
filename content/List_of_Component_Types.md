##  Component Types 

Each [tech](/Tech_Tree "Tech Tree") in HoI2 has five components and each
component has a type. [Tech
teams](/Tech_Teams_by_Country "Tech Teams by Country") have up to five
specializations for a component type. There are 34 component types in
HoI2. Sadly, it is not possible to add any at this point. However, you
can change their appearance and their displayed (not the internally
used) name. There is no game mechanical difference between the red
doctrine component types and the blue technical component types.

The graphic that holds the pics for the tech types is found at
*/gfx/interface/tc_icons.bmp* . The names for the components are found
in */config/tech_names.csv* .
