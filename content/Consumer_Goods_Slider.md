##  Consumer Goods Slider 

The consumer goods slider allocates how much [Industrial
Capacity](/Industrial_Capacity "Industrial Capacity") you will use for
the subject. With certain slider settings, you may get big bonuses of
money from this slider. If you have [dissent](/Dissent "Dissent") in
your country, you can reduce it with high enough Consumer Goods
settings.
