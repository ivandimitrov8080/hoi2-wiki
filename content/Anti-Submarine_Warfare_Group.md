###    Anti-Submarine Warfare Group (ASW Group) 

An **Anti-Submarine Warfare Group** is a group of ships whose role is to
hunt and sink enemy [subs](/Submarine "Submarine") . Since the primary
anti-sub vessel is the DD, this is the core of any ASW group. An escort
carrier is also very deadly for subs. In HoI2 and ARMA, ASW fleets are
quite useful, while in Doomsday, the ASW fleet was largely ineffective.
The Armageddon 1.3beta patch has solved all remaining bugs with the ASW
mission order, and it will now work as intended. Especially late-game,
it is very deadly.

####  ASW Fleet Composition 

Best is smaller numbers for increased range:

-   2 CVLs
-   2 CLs
-   4 DDs (possibly with ASW naval brigade)
