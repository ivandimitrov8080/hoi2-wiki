###    What is the purpose of radar station? 

The functions are:

-   Reduces enemy air units' combat efficiency by 2.5% for each level of
    radar you have in the territory.
-   The effectiveness of this factor can be increased by research. A 30%
    radar efficiency would mean 1.3\*2.5.
-   Coastal radar stations have a combat air battle factor in adjacent
    seazones. On land, however, each province's radar is used only for
    that province without any adjacency effects.

    units](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=218736)

    air-defence](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=218736)
    in HOI2 and HOI2 DD versions 1.0 and 1.1:
    -   Without it the airunits on air-superiority missions will just
        move towards random provinces within the area.
    -   With it, the airunit will know about any planes nearby that is
        heading to/through the province with the radar.
-   Radar [does not provide
    detection](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showpost.php?p=8204611&postcount=27)
    after HOI2DD 1.2 through ARMA 1.2. Two comments by Johan on pg 2 of
    a long thread: [Johan mentions but does not explain the
    change](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=346220&page=2)
-   In ARMA, the radar naval brigade improves naval engagement range
-   Since radar is intelligence related, it's always us vs them
    comparisons for spotting purposes. Slider (open vs closed society),
    relative tech levels for encryption and decryption, and difficulty
    levels influence how well radar detects the enemy.
