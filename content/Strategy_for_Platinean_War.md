##  Platinean War Strategy for Brazil 

Played as Brazil in normal/normal

Here is some tips:

-   When the game starts, strategically redeploy all of your movable
    ground units to Curitiba. Evacuate all naval and air units from
    Porto Alegre to São Paulo. Avoid any naval battle and head straight
    to port.
-   Capturing Concordia after Argentina captures Porto Alegre will leave
    any Argentinian armies in Porte Alegro stranded. Destroy them.
-   Do not produce any factories or infrastructure. Focus on producing
    infantries at all times.
-   When the US offers its assistance, do accept. Although German will
    also give reinforcement to Argentina, the US will send more troops.
-   Focus on annexing Argentina. If any other countries declare on you,
    ignore them until Argentina is gone. The horrible infrastructure in
    Amazon jungle will slow them down.
-   Don't liberate Argentina. Although it gives you a mighty ally and
    practically will make the whole of south america your puppet (as
    Bolivia and/or Peru are easily annexed and liberated), it will get
    16 victory points, leaving you with a maximum of 29/30 victory
    points, if you annex all other nations, your allies included. To
    have a mayor victory you need at least 40, or 30 VP's for a minor
    victory.

  

##  Platinean War Strategy for Argentina 

Played as Argentina against AI:

###  Utilizing assets 

-   Use naval transport to quickest effect. Move infantry units across
    as needed across the country (i.e. from Neuquén provice to closest
    port, then embark to frontlines; same with cavaly and infantry down
    south). Also, you could try amphibious assault on unprotected
    provinces.
-   Research basic construction - this will allow your non-moving units
    to dig in.
-   Order some engineering brigades - you will be doing some fighting in
    river country.
-   Keep a strong naval presence. Carry out naval interdiction missions
    as close north to the Brazilian coast as possible. Also decouple
    "Aviación del Ejército" air group and have the naval bomber wing
    carry out interdiction on its own (avoid flying it close to
    ground-based fighters).
-   Watch who you ally with: accepting an alliance with Bolivia
    (territorial claims on Chile and Paraguay) will automatically earn
    you two enemies on your borders, while not adding too much to your
    alliance. Bolivia is still a good commercial partner even outside
    the alliance.
-   Watch your back: expect Chile to jump into the war anyway and assist
    Brazil by late 1942. Aim to have mountain infantry back on the
    border by November 1942 (sea transport or redeploy as needed) as
    stopgap; then move more infantry divisions in for the offensive.
    After done, you may move them back to business in Brazil.
-   Watch out for the Chilean Battleship, it may be transferred to the
    Brazilian Navy and do some harm after you think you are safe.

###  Strategic objectives 

-   Kick hard and early. You can punch into Curitiba by concentrating
    your attack force at Concordia. The AI has apparently not read the
    above strategy for Brazil but your mileage may vary if playing
    against a human.
-   Minimize a two-front war as much as possible. Defeat Chile as soon
    as possible after they join Brazil. Attack Santiago, then
    Antofagasta and annex. As all goes quiet on the western front, you
    may focus on Brazil.
-   Keep Recife as a major strategy objective (this may mean rolling
    through the coast: São Paulo, Rio, Vitoria, Salvador) as this is
    where US reinforcements arrive. Note that these will keep coming for
    as long as the enemy controls Recife.
-   Taking the coastal path to Recife will deny the enemy some of his
    major industrial base.
-   By the time you have Recife, strategy should shift to rolling
    westwards and acquiring the remaining victory point provinces. Annex
    when done.
-   Note that the 40 VPs needed for Strategic Victory must be owned *by
    Argentina itself* , not by the alliance as a whole. Therefore, after
    defeating Brazil, you might be forced to declare war on one of more
    of your allies in order to achieve Strategic Victory.
