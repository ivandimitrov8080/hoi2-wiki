#  Diplomacy 

###    Where is the option to puppet a nation? 

Unlike in previous Paradox games, puppeting is no longer an explicit
option in the diplomacy menu. You now have to go to "Sue for Peace",
then "Insist on Demands", and puppeting is available as a checkbox
option.

###    Why can't I trade blueprints? 

You may only trade blueprints with allied nations, your puppets or your
puppet master (as the case may be) that have not researched the
technology yet.

###    Why can't I trade provinces? 

You may only trade provinces with allied nations.

###    Playing as Germany, how to increase Italy's chance to join my alliance? 

It is necessary to conquer Belgium's European provinces as well as Paris
to encourage Italy joining Axis.

###    Playing as Germany, how to increase Hungary's chance to join my alliance? 

Hungary is not at war and at least one of these conditions must be true:

-   Germany is at war with Yugoslavia
-   Germany is at war with Soviet

###    Playing as Germany, how to increase Romania's chance to join my alliance? 

Romania is not at war and at least one of these conditions must be true:

-   Germany is at war with Hungary
-   Germany is at war with Soviet
-   Soviet claimed Bessarabia
-   Vienna Diktat is denied by Germany

###    Playing as Germany, how to increase Finland's chance to join my alliance? 

Finland is not at war and at least one of these conditions must be true:

-   Germany is at war with Soviet
-   Winter war occurred

###    Playing as Germany, how to increase Bulgaria's chance to join my alliance? 

Bulgaria is not at war and at least one of these conditions must be
true:

-   Germany is at war with Yugoslavia
-   Germany is at war with Romania and Romania is not in Soviet's
    alliance

###    Playing as Germany, what nations may join my alliance via event? 

As Germany the nations you can get alliances with via events areÂ :
Croatia, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, USSR.

-   Following the annexation of Yugoslavia an event will fire giving you
    the option to free Croatia in return for some free infantry
    divisions and they will join your alliance.

&nbsp;

-   The Austrian anschluss event allows you to ally with Austria rather
    than annexing them, if you so desire.

&nbsp;

-   The Molotov Ribbentrop pact event gives the USSR an opportunity to
    offer Germany an alliance. (The "Unholy Alliance") This is very rare
    to happen though and the AI tends to perform poorly under this
    arrangement.

&nbsp;

-   Slovakia and Czechoslovakia can both be brought to the axis also
    through different paths in the End of Czechoslovakia event chain.
-   Hungary can be got through the Czechoslovakian event chain, if the
    Czechs decide to fight against Germany then Hungary will side with
    Germany.
