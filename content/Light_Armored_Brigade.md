Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their
speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched
Infantry. However, as tanks become heavier, their speeds will reduce
accordingly. They also require a constant supply of fuel to remain in
the field and if this vital supply is severed, the armoured unit will be
almost useless.
