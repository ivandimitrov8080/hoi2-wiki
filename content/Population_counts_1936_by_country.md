This page contains populations of the major countries starting in 1936.
These numbers are going to be used as a base for manpower calculations
for Super AI Bundle. The bullet signifies the main body of the country.
Any sub lines are countries that were formed internally after world war
II and are used in the population counts. These numbers are rounded to
the nearest million. One manpower point equals roughly 1000 soldiers.
The special Infantry divisions will have manpower requirements based off
their historical division sizes.
