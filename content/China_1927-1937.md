)

In an effort to put the majority of the armed forces under his control,
Chiang Kai-shek engaged a program of troop disbandment which was
bitterly opposed by the other warlords. The 4th Group Army of Guangxi,
the 2nd Group Army of Shanxi, and the 2nd Group Army of the Northwest
all rebelled against Chiang. Through Chiang's swift diplomatic
maneuvering, all these rebellions came to be crushed, and their troops
were incorporated into the government forces.

-   the First Army was one of the better equipped of the 8 National
    Revolutionary Armies (NRA)
    -   however, it was not very well equipped
    -   Chiang personally controlled only 3 armies, or about 5-10% of
        the nation's total force
-   in contrast, some other NRA took full advantage of the fighting and
    expanded their forces to impressive size

#  1929 

##  March 

-   The Guangxi Clique, as a result of a crisis seemingly provoked by
    Chiang (3.11) revolted against Nanjing
    -   Guangxi leaders were skilled tacticians and commanded about 230
        000 troops
    -   Feng Yuxiang, commanding 220 00 men would join forces
    -   Chiang bought Feng off with Y2 million and a promise of control
        over Shandong province
    -   Chiang then defeated the Guangxi armies in less than 2 months
    -   Empire of Li Zongrena and Bai Chongxi in Hebei and Hunan-Hubei
        thereupon collapse.
    -   they retreated to their home province of Guangxi

##  April 

-   Feng was going to go to war with Chiang over the disbandment issue,
    but Han Fuqu and Shi Yousan (and 100 000 of Feng's troops) defected
    to the nationalist side.
    -   also, Chiang reneged on his pledge to hand over Shandong
        (3.11-12)
    -   Feng pushed out of Shandong and Henan (3.12)

#  1930 

-   In April 1930, Feng and Yan Xishan organized an Anti-Chiang
    coalition which included the Reorganization faction (led by Wang
    Jingwei (3.12)) and the Western Hill faction (an extreme right
    faction (3.12)) as well.
    -   February and March, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan formed the
        Anti-Chiang coalition, which posed the most serious challenge to
        Chiang's power. (3.12)
    -   Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of the Guangxi clique promised to
        coordinate their attack from South China
    -   in 4 months, the two sides incurred some 250 000 casualties
        (3.12)
    -   In September, the rebel government against Chiang fled from
        Beiping to Taiyuan, Yan's capital (3.12)
    -   Both sides wooed Zhang Xueliang to join them (3.12)
    -   However, Zhang Xueliang threw his support behind Chiang, and the
        rebel cause was doomed
        -   the leader was bribed with 10 million yuan and joined the
            central government in mid-september(3.12)
        -   he was promised that he might administer all of China north
            of the Yellow River (3.12)
        -   he sent 100 000 troops into the Beiping-Tianjin area and
            took control o the major railroads and the rich revenues
            from the Tianjin customs
    -   by October, the Central Plains War was over and both sides
        suffered heavy casualties
    -   the 1930 war broke up the Guominjun of Feng Yuxiang, greatly
        weakened Yan Xishan, and left the Manchurian Army as the only
        respectable military power in northern China
