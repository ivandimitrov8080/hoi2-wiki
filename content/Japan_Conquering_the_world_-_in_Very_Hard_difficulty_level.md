#  [Japan](/Japan "Japan") Conquering the world - in [Very Hard](/index.php?title=Very_Hard&action=edit&redlink=1 "Very Hard (page does not exist)") difficulty level 

##  The conquest of the [USA](/USA "USA") 

Have you noticed that poor USA has just 4+1 non-garrison divisions at
1936, while Japan has more than 40? This means that you can gain about
100 IC within a year.

Simply carry all your land forces to Kwajalein, and carry out a surprise
attack on Hawaii... From there, you can reach San Diego. Don't bother
with California: it is a very rough terrain and no IC at all. If you
have 2 spare divisions, you can take San Francisco and L. A., but your
main aim must be the Eastern Shore. Just take Colon (2,500 kms from San
Diego). Here there is a slight chance you may lose some precious ships
(the most severe blow being the possible loss of some full transports) -
probably during the whole campaign, you will have to save the most now.

From Colon, it's just 2 small jumps to New York. By the time you reach
New York, your navy must have defeated US Navy several times (just stay
together with your main force, and use your 2 Naval Bombers). From
there, conquering the US is quite easy, just have some 6-10 divisions in
reserve for the time when USA deploys some 3-6 militias and infantry. By
1937 summer, you can annex the USA.

##  Next step: [America](/index.php?title=America&action=edit&redlink=1 "America (page does not exist)") 

This is an easy task: just follow the coast, and use your navy wisely.
You will conquer America (except [Canada](/Canada "Canada") ) by the end
of 1938.

##  A tough fight: [China](/index.php?title=China&action=edit&redlink=1 "China (page does not exist)") 

When the [Marco Polo bridge
incident](/index.php?title=Marco_Polo_bridge_incident&action=edit&redlink=1 "Marco Polo bridge incident (page does not exist)")
triggers, choose fight. That 1 Interventionism level worths the loss of
[Manchukuo](/Manchukuo "Manchukuo") and
[Korea](/index.php?title=Korea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Korea (page does not exist)")
. As soon as you have researched Armor type III, build as much as you
can. With your victorious army, and your newly deployed \>10 Armor
divisions, you can defeat the Chinese by around early 1941.

##  [Allies](/Allies "Allies") or [Comintern](/Comintern "Comintern") 

Now you must make a severe decision: either attack the Allies or Soviet
Union. When I first tried this strategy, it was mid-1942 when I finished
with China, and first I attacked SU to help the Germans. But it was a
long fight, and after all, the Germans took the fruit in the shape of
Moscow...

##  Attacking the allies 

This is an easy task, just don't rush for England, for it is filled with
divisions now. Instead, initiate operations in India and in the Middle
East. There you can destroy the major part of UK army, and easily annex
UK.

##  [Germany](/Germany "Germany") - or the [Soviet Union](/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") 

Here comes the biggest fight: if the Soviet Union conquered Germany, she
must have more than 600 divisions by now. Not a big problem though, for
by this time you must have about 50-70 armored divisions, and with the
oil resources of the whole world to call on, you can beat them. Just use
your superior navy, and encircle as many divisions as you can. After the
fall of the Soviet Union, nothing stands between you - and a whole nice
yellow world map!
