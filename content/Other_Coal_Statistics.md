##  Using wood as coal 

This is for those wishing to use wood as an industrial scale energy
source. Wood became uneconomical after 1750, but anyway. My calculations
might not be 100% correct but it should be a decent enough
approximation. Source:
[http://home.europa.com/\~heritage/charcoal.html](http://home.europa.com/~heritage/charcoal.html)
A 10 ton per day furnace can be run needs 3,000 acres of forest or a
half-acre six-foot seam of coal. 3000 acres is about 12 km2. Thus 1
tonne requires 1.2 km2 At the end of the article the following is
written: using charcoal is five times less efficient than using coke.

So each ton of pig iron will require 5 times the amount charcoal as
coal. This charcoal requires wood to be chopped, mounds to be built and
monitored, dry transport and so on.

The annual iron production of Sweden in 1937 was about 9 million tonnes,
so Sweden would need about 11 000 000 km2 of forest per year to convert
this to pig iron Sweden is about 2500 km\* 500 km=12 500 000 km2 Swedish
trees take about 40-80 years to reach maturity so using 60 as an average
gives that the annual forest increase will be enough to cover about 2%
of the Swedish iron ore production
